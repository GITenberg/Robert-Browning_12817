<h2>Editor's Preface</h2>
<br />
<p>"In the case of those whom the public has learned to
honour and admire, there is a <i>biography of the mind</i>&#8212;the
phrase is Mr Gladstone's&#8212;that is a matter of
deep interest." In a life of Robert Browning it is
especially true that the biography we want is of this
nature, for its events are to be classed rather among
achievements of the human spirit than as objective
incidents, and its interest depends only in a secondary
sense on circumstance or movement in the public eye.
The special function of the present book in the growing
library of Browning literature is to give such a biography
of Browning's mind, associating his poems
with their date and origin, as may throw some light
on his inward development. Browning has become to
many, in a measure which he could hardly have conceived
possible himself, one of the authoritative
interpreters of the spiritual factors in human life.
His tonic optimism dissipates the grey atmosphere of
materialism, which has obscured the sunclad heights
of life as effectually as a fog. To see life through
Browning's eyes is to see it shot through and through
with spiritual issues, with a background of eternal
destiny; and to come appreciably nearer than the
general consciousness of our time to seeing it steadily
and seeing it whole. Those who prize his influence
know how to value everything which throws light on
the path by which he reached his resolute and confident
outlook.</p>
<p>It is almost possible to count on the fingers of one
hand the few men who could successfully write a book
of this character and scope. The Editor believes that,
in the present case, one of the very few has been found
who had the qualifications required. Much of the
apparent obscurity of Browning is due to his habit of
climbing up a precipice of thought, and then kicking
away the ladder by which he climbed. Dr Dowden
has with singular success readjusted the steps, so that
readers may follow the poet's climb. Those who are
not daunted by the Paracelsus and Sordello chapter,
where the subject requires some close and patient
attention, will find vigorous narrative and pellucid
exposition interwoven in such a way as to keep them
in intimate and constantly closer touch with the
"biography of Browning's mind."</p>

<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>An attempt is made in this volume to tell the story
of Browning's life, including, as part of it, a notice of
his books, which may be regarded as the chief of "his
acts and all that he did." I have tried to keep my
reader in constant contact with Browning's mind and
art, and thus a sense of the growth and development
of his genius ought to form itself before the close.</p>
<p>The materials accessible for a biography, apart from
Browning's published writings, are not copious. He
destroyed many letters; many, no doubt, are in private
hands. For some parts of his life I have been able
to add little to what Mrs Orr tells. But since her
biography of Browning was published a good deal of
interesting matter has appeared. The publication of
"The Letters of Robert Browning and Elizabeth
Barrett Browning" has enabled me to construct a short,
close-knit narrative of the incidents that led up to
Browning's marriage. From that date until the death
of Mrs Browning her "Letters," edited by Mr Kenyon,
has been my chief source. My method has not been
that of quotation, but the substance of many letters is
fused, as far as was possible, into a brief, continuous story.
Two privately issued volumes of Browning's letters,
edited by Mr T.J. Wise, and Mr Wise's "Browning
Bibliography" have been of service to me. Mr Gosse's
"Robert Browning, Personalia," Mrs Ritchie's "Tennyson,
Ruskin and Browning," the "Life of Tennyson" by
his son, Mr Henry James's volumes on W.W. Story,
letters of Dante Rossetti, the diary of Mr W.M.
Rossetti, with other writings of his, memoirs, reminiscences
or autobiographies of Lady Martin, F.T.
Palgrave, Jowett, Sir James Paget, Gavan Duffy,
Robert Buchanan, Rudolf Lehmann, W.J. Stillman,
T.A. Trollope, Miss F.P. Cobbe, Miss Swanwick, and
others have been consulted. And several interesting
articles in periodicals, in particular Mrs Arthur
Bronson's articles "Browning in Venice" and "Browning
in Asolo," have contributed to my narrative. For
some information about Browning's father and mother,
and his connection with York Street Independent
Chapel, I am indebted to Mr F. Herbert Stead,
Warden of "The Robert Browning Settlement,"
Walworth. I thank Messrs Smith, Elder and Co.,
as representing Mr R. Barrett Browning, for permission
to make such quotations as I have ventured to make
from copyright letters. I thank the general Editor
of this series, the Rev. D. Macfadyen, for kind and
valuable suggestions.</p>
<p>My study of Browning's poems is chronological.
I recognise the disadvantages of this method, but I
also perceive certain advantages. Many years ago in
"Studies in Literature" I attempted a general view
of Browning's work, and wrote, as long ago as 1867, a
careful study of <i>Sordello</i>. What I now write may
suffer as well as gain from a familiarity of so many
years with his writings. But to make them visible
objects to me I have tried to put his poems outside
myself, and approach them with a fresh mind.
Whether I have failed or partly succeeded I am
unable to determine.</p>
<p>The analysis of <i>La Saisiaz</i> appeared&#8212;substantially&#8212;in
the little Magazine of the Home Reading Union,
and one or two other short passages are recovered
from uncollected articles of mine. I have incorporated
in my criticism a short passage from one of my wife's
articles on Browning in <i>The Dark Blue Magazine</i>,
making such modifications as suited my purpose,
and she has contributed a passage to the pages
which close this volume.</p>
<p>I had the privilege of some personal acquaintance
with Browning, and have several cordial letters of
his addressed to my wife and to myself. These I
have not thought it right to use.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_1"></a>Chapter I</h2>
<h2>Childhood and Youth</h2>
<br />
<p>The ancestry of Robert Browning has been traced<a name="FNanchor_1"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
to an earlier Robert who lived in the service of Sir
John Bankes of Corfe Castle, and died in 1746. His
eldest son, Thomas, "was granted a lease for three
lives of the little inn, in the little hamlet of East
Woodyates and parish of Pentridge, nine miles south-west
of Salisbury on the road to Exeter." Robert,
born in 1749, the son of this Thomas, and grandfather
of the poet, became a clerk in the Bank of
England, and rose to be principal in the Bank Stock
Office. At the age of twenty-nine he married Margaret
Tittle, a lady born in the West Indies and possessed
of West Indian property. He is described by Mrs
Orr as an able, energetic, and worldly man. He lived
until his grandson was twenty-one years old. His
first wife was the mother of another Robert, the poet's
father, born in 1781. When the boy had reached the
age of seven he lost his mother, and five years later
his father married again. This younger Robert when
a youth desired to become an artist, but such a career
was denied to him. He longed for a University
education, and, through the influence of his stepmother,
this also was refused. They shipped the
young man to St Kitts, purposing that he should
<a name="Page_2"></a>oversee the West Indian estate. There, as Browning
on the authority of his mother told Miss Barrett,
"he conceived such a hatred to the slave-system ...
that he relinquished every prospect, supported himself
while there in some other capacity, and came back,
while yet a boy, to his father's profound astonishment
and rage."<a name="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
At the age of twenty-two he obtained
a clerkship in the Bank of England, an employment
which, his son says, he always detested. Eight years
later he married Sarah Anna, daughter of William
Wiedemann, a Dundee shipowner, who was the son
of a German merchant of Hamburg. The young
man's father, on hearing that his son was a suitor to
Miss Wiedemann, had waited benevolently on her
uncle "to assure him that his niece would be thrown
away on a man so evidently born to be hanged."<a name="FNanchor_3"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
In 1811 the new-married pair settled in Camberwell,
and there in a house in Southampton Street Robert
Browning&#8212;an only son&#8212;was born on May 7, 1812.
Two years later (Jan. 7, 1814) his sister, Sarah
Anna&#8212;an only daughter&#8212;known in later years as
Sarianna, a form adopted by her father, was born.
She survived her brother, dying in Venice on the
morning of April 22, 1903.<a name="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
<p>Robert Browning's father and mother were persons
who for their own sakes deserve to be remembered.
His father, while efficient in his work in the Bank,
<a name="Page_3"></a>was a wide and exact reader of literature,
classical as
well as modern. We are told by Mrs Orr of his
practice of soothing his little boy to sleep "by humming
to him an ode of Anacreon," and by Dr Moncure
Conway that he was versed in mediaeval legend, and
seemed to have known Paracelsus, Faustus, and even
Talmudic personages with an intimate familiarity.
He wrote verses in excellent couplets of the
eighteenth century manner, and strung together
fantastic rhymes as a mode of aiding his boy in
tasks which tried the memory. He was a dexterous
draughtsman, and of his amateur handiwork in portraiture
and caricature&#8212;sometimes produced, as it
were, instinctively, with a result that was unforeseen&#8212;much
remains to prove his keen eye and his skill
with the pencil. Besides the curious books which he
eagerly collected, he also gathered together many
prints&#8212;those of Hogarth especially, and in early states.
He had a singular interest, such as may also be seen
in the author of <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, in investigating
and elucidating complex criminal cases.<a name="FNanchor_5"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> He was
a lover of athletic sports and never knew ill-health.
For the accumulation of riches he had no talent and
no desire, but he had a simple wealth of affection
which he bestowed generously on his children and his
friends. "My father," wrote Browning, "is tender-hearted
to a fault.... To all women and children
he is chivalrous." "He had," writes Mr W.J. Stillman,
who knew Browning's father in Paris in his elder
years, "the perpetual juvenility of a blessed child. If
to live in the world as if not of it indicates a saintly
<a name="Page_4"></a>nature, then Robert Browning the elder was a
saint;
a serene, untroubled soul, conscious of no moral or
theological problem to disturb his serenity, and as
gentle as a gentle woman; a man in whom, it seemed
to me, no moral conflict could ever have arisen to
cloud his frank acceptance of life, as he found it come
to him.... His unworldliness had not a flaw."<a name="FNanchor_6"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> To
Dante Rossetti he appeared, as an old man, "lovable
beyond description," with that "submissive yet highly
cheerful simplicity of character which often ...
appears in the family of a great man, who uses at
last what the others have kept for him." He is,
Rossetti continues, "a complete oddity&#8212;with a real
genius for drawing&#8212;but caring for nothing in the
least except Dutch boors,&#8212;fancy, the father of
Browning!&#8212;and as innocent as a child." Browning
himself declared that he had not one artistic taste in
common with his father&#8212;"in pictures, he goes 'souls
away' to Brauwer, Ostade, Teniers ... he would turn
from the Sistine Altar-piece to these&#8212;in music he
desiderates a tune 'that has a story connected with
it.'" Yet Browning inherited much from his father,
and was ready to acknowledge his gains. In <i>Development</i>,
one of the poems of his last volume, he recalls
his father's sportive way of teaching him at five years
old, with the aid of piled-up chairs and tables&#8212;the
cat for Helen, and Towzer and Tray as the Atreidai,&#8212;the
story of the siege of Troy, and, later, his urging
the boy to read the tale "properly told" in the translation
of Homer by his favourite poet, Pope. He
lived almost to the close of his eighty-fifth year, and
if he was at times bewildered by his son's poetry, he
<a name="Page_5"></a>came nearer to it in intelligent sympathy as he
grew
older, and he had for long the satisfaction of enjoying
his son's fame.</p>
<p>The attachment of Robert Browning to his mother&#8212;"the
true type of a Scottish gentlewoman," said
Carlyle&#8212;was deep and intimate. For him she was,
in his own phrase, "a divine woman"; her death in
1849 was to Browning almost an overwhelming blow.
She was of a nature finely and delicately strung. Her
nervous temperament seems to have been transmitted&#8212;robust
as he was in many ways&#8212;to her son.
The love of music, which her Scottish-German father
possessed in a high degree, leaping over a generation,
reappeared in Robert Browning. His capacity for
intimate friendships with animals&#8212;spider and toad
and lizard&#8212;was surely an inheritance from his mother.
Mr Stillman received from Browning's sister an
account of her mother's unusual power over both wild
creatures and household pets. "She could lure the
butterflies in the garden to her," which reminds us of
Browning's whistling for lizards at Asolo. A fierce
bull-dog intractable to all others, to her was docile
and obedient. In her domestic ways she was gentle
yet energetic. Her piety was deep and pure. Her
husband had been in his earlier years a member of
the Anglican communion; she was brought up in the
Scottish kirk. Before her marriage she became a
member of the Independent congregation, meeting
for worship at York Street, Lock's Fields, Walworth,
where now stands the Robert Browning Hall. Her husband
attached himself to the same congregation;
both were teachers in the Sunday School. Mrs
Browning kept, until within a few years of her death,
<a name="Page_6"></a>a missionary box for contributions to the London
Missionary Society. The conditions of membership
implied the acceptance of "those views of doctrinal
truth which for the sake of distinction are called
Calvinistic." Thus over the poet's childhood and
youth a religious influence presided; it was not sacerdotal,
nor was it ascetic; the boy was in those early
days, as he himself declared, "passionately religious."
Their excellent pastor was an entirely "unimaginative
preacher of the Georgian era," who held fast by the
approved method of "three heads and a conclusion."
Browning's indifference to the ministrations of Mr
Clayton was not concealed, and on one occasion he
received a rebuke in the presence of the congregation.
Yet the spirit of religion which surrounded and
penetrated him was to remain with him, under all its
modifications, to the end. "His face," wrote the Rev.
Edward White, "is vividly present to my memory
through the sixty years that have intervened. It was
the most wonderful face in the whole congregation&#8212;pale,
somewhat mysterious, and shaded with black,
flowing hair, but a face whose expression you remember
through a life-time. Scarcely less memorable
were the countenances of his father, mother and sister."<a
 name="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>
<p>Robert Browning, writes Mrs Orr, "was a handsome,
vigorous, fearless child, and soon developed an
unresting activity and a fiery temper." His energy
of mind made him a swift learner. After the elementary
lessons in reading had been achieved, he was
<a name="Page_7"></a>prepared for the neighbouring school of the Rev.
Thomas Ready by Mr Ready's sisters. Having
entered this school as a day-boarder, he remained
under Mr Ready's care until the year 1826. To
facile companionship with his school-fellows Browning
was not prone, but he found among them one or two
abiding friends. As for the rest, though he was no
winner of school prizes, he seems to have acquired a
certain intellectual mastery over his comrades; some
of them were formed into a dramatic <i>troupe</i> for the
performance of his boyish plays. Perhaps the better
part of his education was that of his hours at home.
He read widely in his father's excellent library. The
favourite books of his earliest years, Croxall's <i>Fables</i>
and Quarles's <i>Emblems</i>, were succeeded by others
which made a substantial contribution to his mind.
A list given by Mrs Orr includes Walpole's <i>Letters</i>,
Junius, Voltaire, and Mandeville's <i>Fable of the Bees</i>.
The first book he ever bought with his own money
was Macpherson's <i>Ossian</i>, and the first composition he
committed to paper, written years before his purchase
of the volume, was an imitation of Ossian, "whom,"
says Browning, "I had not read, but conceived, through
two or three scraps in other books." His early feeling
for art was nourished by visits to the Dulwich Gallery,
to which he obtained an entrance when far under the
age permitted by the rules; there he would sit for an
hour before some chosen picture, and in later years he
could recall the "wonderful Rembrandt of Jacob's
vision," the Giorgione music-lesson, the "triumphant
Murillo pictures," "such a Watteau," and "all the
Poussins."<a name="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>
<p><a name="Page_8"></a>Among modern poets Byron at first with him held
the chief place. Boyish verses, written under the
Byronic influence, were gathered into a group when
the writer was but twelve years old; a title&#8212;<i>Incondita</i>&#8212;was
found, and Browning's parents had serious
intentions of publishing the manuscript. Happily the
manuscript, declined by publishers, was in the end
destroyed, and editors have been saved from the
necessity of printing or reprinting these crudities of a
great poet's childhood. Their only merit, he assured
Mr Gosse, lay in "their mellifluous smoothness." It
was an event of capital importance in the history of
Browning's mind when&#8212;probably in his thirteenth
year&#8212;he lighted, in exploring a book-stall, upon a
copy of one of the pirated editions of Shelley's <i>Queen
Mab</i> and other poems. Through the zeal of his good
mother on the boy's behalf the authorised editions
were at a later time obtained; and she added to her
gift the works, as far as they were then in print, of
Keats.<a name="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
If ever there was a period of <i>Sturm und
Drang</i> in Browning's life, it was during the years in
which he caught from Shelley the spirit of the higher
revolt. A new faith and unfaith came to him, radiant
with colour, luminous with the brightness of dawn, and
uttered with a new, keen, penetrating melody. The
outward conduct of his life was obedient in all essentials
to the good laws of use and wont. He pursued his
various studies&#8212;literature, languages, music&#8212;with
energy. He was diligent&#8212;during a brief attendance&#8212;<a name="Page_9"></a>in
Professor Long's Greek class at University College&#8212;"a
bright, handsome youth," as a classfellow has
described him, "with long black hair falling over his
shoulders." He sang, he danced, he rode, he boxed,
he fenced. But below all these activities a restless
inward current ran. For a time he became, as Mrs
Orr has put it, "a professing atheist and a practising
vegetarian;" and together with the growing-pains of
intellectual independence there was present a certain
aggressive egoism. He loved his home, yet he chafed
against some of its social limitations. Of friendships
outside his home we read of that with Alfred Domett,
the 'Waring' of his poems, afterwards the poet and
the statesman of New Zealand; with Joseph Arnould,
afterwards the Indian judge; and with his cousin
James Silverthorne, the 'Charles' of Browning's pathetic
poem <i>May and Death</i>. We hear also of a tender
boyish sentiment, settling into friendship, for Miss
Eliza Flower, his senior by nine years, for whose
musical compositions he had an ardent admiration:
"I put it apart from all other English music I know,"
he wrote as late as 1845, "and fully believe in it as
<i>the</i> music we all waited for." With her sister Sarah,
two years younger than Eliza, best known by her
married name Sarah Flower Adams and remembered
by her hymn, written in 1840, "Nearer my God to
Thee," he discussed as a boy his religious difficulties,
and in proposing his own doubts drew forth her latent
scepticism as to the orthodox beliefs. "It was in
answering Robert Browning;" she wrote, "that my
mind refused to bring forward argument, turned
recreant, and sided with the enemy." Something
of this period of Browning's <i>Sturm und Drang</i>
<a name="Page_10"></a>can be divined through the ideas and imagery of
<i>Pauline.</i><a name="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>
<p>The finer influence of Shelley upon the genius of
Browning in his youth proceeded from something
quite other than those doctrinaire abstractions&#8212;the
formulas of revolution&#8212;which Shelley had caught up
from Godwin and certain French thinkers of the
eighteenth century. Browning's spirit from first to
last was one which was constantly reaching upward
through the attainments of earth to something that
lay beyond them. A climbing spirit, such as his,
seemed to perceive in Shelley a spirit that not only
climbed but soared. He could in those early days
have addressed to Shelley words written later, and
suggested, one cannot but believe, by his feeling for
his wife:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>You must be just before, in fine,<br />
</span><span>See and make me see, for your part,<br />
</span><span>New depths of the Divine!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Shelley opened up for his young and enthusiastic
follower new vistas leading towards the infinite,
towards the unattainable Best. Browning's only piece
of prose criticism&#8212;apart from scattered comments in
his letters&#8212;is the essay introductory to that volume
of letters erroneously ascribed to Shelley, which was
published when Browning was but little under forty
years old. It expresses his mature feelings and convictions;
and these doubtless contain within them as
their germ the experience of his youth.<a name="FNanchor_11"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Shelley
<a name="Page_11"></a>appears to him as a poet gifted with a fuller
perception
of nature and man than that of the average mind, and
striving to embody the thing he perceives "not so
much with reference to the many below, as to the One
above him, the supreme Intelligence which apprehends
all things in their absolute truth&#8212;an ultimate view
ever aspired to, if but partially attained, by the poet's
own soul." If Shelley was deficient in some subordinate
powers which support and reinforce the purely
poetic gifts, he possessed the highest faculty and in
this he lived and had his being. "His spirit invariably
saw and spoke from the last height to which it had
attained." What was "his noblest and predominating
characteristic" as a poet? Browning attempts to give
it definition: it was "his simultaneous perception of
Power and Love in the absolute, and of Beauty and
Good in the concrete, while he throws, from his
poet's station between both, swifter, subtler, and more
numerous films for the connexion of each with each,
than have been thrown by any modern artificer of
whom I have knowledge." In other words it was
Shelley's special function to fling an aerial bridge from
reality, as we commonly understand that word, to the
higher reality which we name the ideal; to set up an
aerial ladder&#8212;not less solid because it is aerial&#8212;upon
the earth, whose top reached to heaven. Such was
Browning's conception of Shelley, and it pays little
regard either to atheistic theory or vegetarian practice.</p>
<p>A time came when Robert Browning must make
choice of a future career. His interests in life were
<a name="Page_12"></a>manifold, but in some form or another art was the
predominant interest. His father remembered his
own early inclinations, and how they had been
thwarted; he recognised the rare gifts of his son, and
he resolved that he should not be immured in the
office of a bank. Should he plead at the bar?
Should he paint? Should he be a maker of music, as
he at one time desired, and for music he always possessed
an exceptional talent? When his father spoke
to him, Robert Browning knew that his sister was not
dependent on any effort of his to provide the means
of living. "He appealed," writes Mr Gosse, "to his
father, whether it would not be better for him to see
life in the best sense, and cultivate the powers of his
mind, than to shackle himself in the very outset of his
career by a laborious training, foreign to that aim.
... So great was the confidence of the father in the
genius of his son that the former at once acquiesced in
the proposal." It was decided that he should take to
what an old woman of the lake district, speaking of
"Mr Wudsworth," described as "the poetry business."
The believing father was even prepared to invest some
capital in the concern. At his expense <i>Paracelsus,
Sordello</i>, and <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i> were published.</p>
<p>A poet may make his entrance into literature with
small or large inventions, by carving cherry-stones or
carving a colossus. Browning, the creator of men
and women, the fashioner of minds, would be a
sculptor of figures more than life-size rather than an
exquisite jeweller; the attempt at a Perseus of this
Cellini was to precede his brooches and buttons. He
planned, Mr Gosse tells us, "a series of monodramatic
epics, narratives of the life of typical souls." In a
<a name="Page_13"></a>modification of this vast scheme <i>Paracelsus</i>,
which
includes more speakers than one, and <i>Sordello</i>, which
is not dramatic in form, find their places. They were
preceded by <i>Pauline</i>, in the strictest sense a monodrama,
a poem not less large in conception than either
of the others, though this "fragment of a confession"
is wrought out on a more contracted scale.</p>
<p><i>Pauline</i>, published without the writer's name&#8212;his
aunt Silverthorne bearing the cost of publication&#8212;was
issued from the press in January 1833.<a name="FNanchor_12"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Browning
had not yet completed his twenty-first year.
When including it among his poetical works in 1867,
he declared that he did so with extreme repugnance
and solely with a view to anticipate unauthorised
republication of what was no more than a "crude
preliminary sketch," entirely lacking in good draughtsmanship
and right handling. For the edition of
twenty years later, 1888, he revised and corrected
<i>Pauline</i> without re-handling it to any considerable
extent. In truth <i>Pauline</i> is a poem from which
Browning ought not to have desired to detach his
mature self. Rarely does a poem by a writer so young
deserve better to be read for its own sake. It is an interesting
document in the history of its author's mind.
It gives promises and pledges which were redeemed
in full. It shows what dropped away from the poet
and what, being an essential part of his equipment,
was retained. It exhibits his artistic method in the
process of formation. It sets forth certain leading
thoughts which are dominant in his later work. The
first considerable production of a great writer must
<a name="Page_14"></a>always claim attention from the student of his
mind
and art.</p>
<p>The poem is a study in what Browning in his
<i>Fifine</i> terms "mental analysis"; it attempts to shadow
forth, through the fluctuating moods of the dying man,
a series of spiritual states. The psychology is sometimes
crude; subtle, but clumsily subtle; it is, however, essentially
the writer's own. To construe clearly the states of
mind which are adumbrated rather than depicted is
difficult, for Browning had not yet learnt to manifest
his generalised conceptions through concrete details,
to plunge his abstractions in reality. The speaker
in the poem tells us that he "rudely shaped his life
to his immediate wants"; this is intelligible, yet only
vaguely intelligible, for we do not know what were
these wants, and we do not see any rude shaping of
his life. We are told of "deeds for which remorse
were vain"; what were these deeds? did he, like
Bunyan, play cat on Sunday, or join the ringers of
the church bells? "Instance, instance," we cry impatiently.
And so the story remains half a shadow.
The poem is dramatic, yet, like so much of Browning's
work, it is not pure drama coming from profound
sympathy with a spirit other than the writer's own;
it is only hybrid drama, in which the <i>dramatis persona</i>
thinks and moves and acts under the necessity of expounding
certain ideas of the poet. Browning's puppets
are indeed too often in his earlier poems moved by
intellectual wires; the hands are the hands of Luria or
Djabal, but the voice is the showman's voice. A
certain intemperance in the pursuit of poetic beauty,
strange and lovely imagery which obscures rather
than interprets, may be regarded as in <i>Pauline</i> the
<a name="Page_15"></a>fault or the glory of youth; a young heir arrived
at
his inheritance will scatter gold pieces. The verse
has caught something of its affluent flow, its wavelike
career, wave advancing upon wave, from Shelley:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait;<br />
</span><span>He rises on the toe; that spirit of his<br />
</span><span>In aspiration lifts him from the earth.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The aspiration in Browning's later verse is a complex
of many forces; here it is a simple poetic
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>By virtue of its central theme <i>Pauline</i> is closely
related to the poems which at no great distance
followed&#8212;<i>Paracelsus</i> and <i>Sordello</i>. Each is a study
of the flaws which bring genius to all but ruin, a
study of the erroneous conduct of life by men of
extraordinary powers. In each poem the chief
personage aspires and fails, yet rises&#8212;for Browning
was not of the temper to accept ultimate failures, and
postulated a heaven to warrant his optimistic creed&#8212;rises
at the close from failure to a spiritual recovery,
which may be regarded as attainment, but an attainment,
as far as earth and its uses are concerned,
marred and piteous; he recovers in the end his true
direction, but recovers it only for service in worlds
other than ours which he may hereafter traverse.
He has been seduced or conquered by alien forces
and through some inward flaw; he has been faithless
to his highest faculties; he has not fulfilled his seeming
destiny; yet before death and the darkness of
death arrive, light has come; he perceives the wanderings
of the way, and in one supreme hour or in one
shining moment he gives indefeasible pledges of the
loyalty which he has forfeited. Shelley in <i>Alastor</i>, the
<a name="Page_16"></a>influence of which on Browning in writing <i>Pauline</i>
is
evident, had rebuked the idealist within himself, who
would live in lofty abstractions to the loss of human
sympathy and human love. Browning in <i>Pauline</i> also
recognises this danger, but he indicates others&#8212;the risk
of the lower faculties of the mind encroaching upon
and even displacing the higher, the risk of the spirit of
aggrandisement, even in the world of the imagination,
obtaining the mastery over the spirit of surrender to
that which is higher than self. It is quite right and
needful to speak of the "lesson" of Browning's poem,
and the lesson of <i>Pauline</i> is designed to inculcate first
loyalty to a man's highest power, and secondly a
worshipping loyalty and service to that which transcends
himself, named by the speaker in <i>Pauline</i> by
the old and simple name of God.</p>
<p>Was it the problem of his own life&#8212;that concerning
the conduct of high, intellectual and spiritual powers&#8212;which
Browning transferred to his art, creating
personages other than himself to be exponents of his
theme? We cannot tell; but the problem in varied
forms persists from poem to poem. The poet imagined
as twenty years of age, who makes his fragment of a
confession in <i>Pauline</i>, is more than a poet; he is rather
of the Sordello type than of the type represented in
Eglamor and Aprile.<a name="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
Through his imagination he
would comprehend and possess all forms of life, of
beauty, of joy in nature and in humanity; but he must
also feel himself at the centre of these, the lord and
master of his own perceptions and creations; and yet,
<a name="Page_17"></a>at the same time, this man is made for the
worship
and service of a power higher than self. How is such
a nature as this to attain its true ends? What are
its special dangers? If he content himself with the
exercise of the subordinate faculties, intellectual
dexterity, wit, social charm and mastery, he is lost;
if he should place himself at the summit, and cease
to worship and to love, he is lost. He cannot alter
his own nature; he cannot ever renounce his intense
consciousness of self, nor even the claim of self to a
certain supremacy as the centre of its own sympathies
and imaginings. So much is inevitable, and is right.
But if he be true to his calling as poet, he will task
his noblest faculty, will live in it, and none the less
look upward, in love, in humility, in the spirit of loyal
service, in the spirit of glad aspiration, to that Power
which leans above him and has set him his earthly
task.</p>
<p>Such reduced to a colourless and abstract statement
is the theme dealt with in <i>Pauline</i>. The young poet,
who, through a fading autumn evening, lies upon his
death-bed, has been faithless to his high calling, and
yet never wholly faithless. As the pallid light declines,
he studies his own soul, he reviews his past, he traces
his wanderings from the way, and all has become clear.
He has failed for the uses of earth; but he recognises
in himself capacities and desires for which no adequate
scope could ever have been found in this life; and
restored to the spirit of love, of trust, by such love,
such trust as he can give Pauline, he cannot deny the
witnessing audible within his own heart to a future
life which may redeem the balance of his temporal
loss. The thought which plays so large a part in
<a name="Page_18"></a>Browning's later poetry is already present and
potent
here.</p>
<p>Two incidents in the history of a soul&#8212;studied by
the speaker under the wavering lights of his hectic
malady and fluctuating moods of passion&#8212;are dealt
with in a singularly interesting and original way. He
describes, with strange and beautiful imagery, the
cynical, bitter pleasure&#8212;few of us do not know it&#8212;which
the intellectual faculties sometimes derive from
mocking and drawing down to their own level the
spiritual powers, the intuitive powers, which are
higher than they, higher, yet less capable of justification
or verification by the common tests of sense and
understanding. The witchcraft of the brain degrades
the god in us:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>And then I was a young witch whose blue eyes,<br />
</span><span>As she stood naked by the river springs,<br />
</span><span>Drew down a god: I watched his radiant form<br />
</span><span>Growing less radiant, and it gladdened me.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>What he presents with such intensity of imaginative
power Browning must have known&#8212;even if it were
but for moments&#8212;by experience. And again, there is
impressive truth and originality in the description of
the state of the poet's mind which succeeded the wreck
of his early faith and early hopes inspired by the
voice of Shelley&#8212;the revolutionary faith in liberty,
equality and human perfectibility. Wordsworth in
<i>The Prelude</i>&#8212;unpublished when Browning wrote
<i>Pauline</i>&#8212;which is also the history of a poet's mind,
has described his own experience of the loss of all
these shining hopes and lofty abstractions, and the
temper of mind which he describes is one of moral
chaos and spiritual despair. The poet of <i>Pauline</i>
<a name="Page_19"></a>turns from political and social abstractions to
real
life, and the touch of reality awakens him as if from
a splendid dream; but his mood is not so sane as
that of despair. He falls back, with a certain joy,
upon the exercise of his inferior powers; he wakes
suddenly and "without heart-wreck ":</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>First went my hopes of perfecting mankind,<br />
</span><span>Next&#8212;faith in them, and then in freedom's self<br />
</span><span>And virtue's self, then my own motives, ends,<br />
</span><span>And aims and loves, and human love went last.<br />
</span><span>I felt this no decay, because new powers<br />
</span><span>Rose as old feelings left&#8212;wit, mockery,<br />
</span><span>Light-heartedness; for I had oft been sad,<br />
</span><span>Mistrusting my resolves, but now I cast<br />
</span><span>Hope joyously away; I laughed and said<br />
</span><span>"No more of this!"<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>It is difficult to believe that Browning is wholly
dramatic here; we seem to discover something of that
period of <i>Sturm und Drang</i>, when his mood grew
restless and aggressive. The homage paid to Shelley,
whose higher influence Browning already perceived to
be in large measure independent of his creed of
revolution, has in it certainly something of the spirit
of autobiography. In this enthusiastic admiration for
Shelley there is nothing to regret, except the unhappy
extravagance of the name "Suntreader," which he
invented as a title for the poet of <i>Alastor</i> and
<i>Prometheus Unbound.</i></p>
<p>The attention of Mr W.J. Fox, a Unitarian
minister of note, had been directed to Browning's
early unpublished verse by Miss Flower. In the
<i>Monthly Repository</i> (April 1833) which he then
edited, Mr Fox wrote of <i>Pauline</i> with admiration,
and Browning was duly grateful for this earliest public
<a name="Page_20"></a>recognition of his genius as a poet. In the <i>Athenaeum</i>
Allen Cunningham made an effort to be appreciative
and sympathetic. John Stuart Mill desired to be the
reviewer of <i>Pauline</i> in <i>Taifs Magazine</i>; there, however,
the poem had been already dismissed with one
contemptuous phrase. It found few readers, but the
admiration of one of these, who discovered <i>Pauline</i>
many years later, was a sufficient compensation for the
general indifference or neglect. "When Mr Browning
was living in Florence, he received a letter from a
young painter whose name was quite unknown to him,
asking him whether he were the author of a poem
called <i>Pauline</i>, which was somewhat in his manner,
and which the writer had so greatly admired that he
had transcribed the whole of it in the British Museum
reading-room. The letter was signed D.G. Rossetti,
and thus began Mr Browning's acquaintance with this
eminent man."<a name="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

M. Rossetti in "D.G. Rossetti, his Family Letters," i. 115, gives the

<h2>Paracelsus and Sordello</h2>
<br />
<p>There is little of incident in Browning's life to be
recorded for the period between the publication of
<i>Pauline</i> and the publication of <i>Paracelsus</i>. During
the winter of 1833-1834 he spent three months in
Russia, "nominally," says Mrs Orr, "in the character
of secretary" to the Russian consul-general, Mr Benckhausen.
Memories of the endless pine-forests through
which he was driven on the way to St Petersburg may
have contributed long afterwards to descriptive passages
of <i>Ivan Ivanovitch.</i></p>
<p>In 1842 or 1843 he wrote a drama in five acts to
which was given the name "Only a Player-girl"; the
manuscript lay for long in his portfolio and never saw
the light. "It was Russian," he tells Miss Barrett,
"and about a fair on the Neva, and booths and
droshkies and fish-pies and so forth, with the Palaces
in the background."<a name="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
Late in life, at Venice, Browning
became acquainted with an old Russian, Prince
Gagarin, with whom he competed successfully for an
hour in recalling folk-songs and national airs of Russia
<a name="Page_22"></a>caught up during the visit of 1833-34. "His
memory,"
said Gagarin, "is better than my own, on which I have
hitherto piqued myself not a little."<a name="FNanchor_16"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> Perhaps it was
his wanderings abroad that made Browning at this
time desire further wanderings. He thought of a
diplomatic career, and felt some regret when he failed
to obtain an appointment for which he had applied in
connection with a mission to Persia.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1834 Browning was at work on
<i>Paracelsus</i>, which, after disappointments with other
houses, was accepted, on terms that secured the publisher
from risk, by Effingham Wilson, and appeared before
midsummer of the following year. The subject had
been suggested by Count Am&eacute;d&eacute;e de Ripert-Monclar,
a young French royalist, engaged in secret service on
behalf of the dethroned Bourbons. To him the poem
is dedicated. For a befitting treatment of the story
of Paracelsus special studies were necessary, and
Browning entered into these with zeal, taking in his
poem&#8212;as he himself believed&#8212;only trifling liberties
with the matter of history. In solitary midnight walks
he meditated his theme and its development. "There
was, in particular," Mr Sharp tells us, "a wood near
Dulwich, whither he was wont to go." Mr Sharp adds
that at this time Browning composed much in the
open air, and that "the glow of distant London" at
night, with the thought of its multitudinous human
life, was an inspiring influence. The sea which spoke
to Browning with most expressive utterances was
always the sea of humanity.</p>
<p>In its combination of thought with passion, and
<a name="Page_23"></a>not less in its expression of a certain premature
worldly wisdom, <i>Paracelsus</i> is an extraordinary output
of mind made by a writer who, when his work was
accomplished, had not completed his twenty-third year.
The poem is the history of a great spirit, who has
sought lofty and unattainable ends, who has fallen
upon the way and is bruised and broken, but who
rises at the close above his ruined self, and wrings
out of defeat a pledge of ultimate victory. In a
preface to the first edition, a preface afterwards
omitted, Browning claims originality, or at least
novelty, for his artistic method; "instead of having
recourse to an external machinery of incidents to
create and evolve the crisis I desire to produce, I
have ventured to display somewhat minutely the mood
itself in its rise and progress, and have suffered the
agency by which it is influenced and determined, to
be generally discernible in its effects alone, and subordinate
throughout, if not altogether excluded." The
poem, though dramatic, is not a drama, and canons
which are applicable to a piece intended for stage-representation
would here&#8212;Browning pleads&#8212;be
rather a hindrance than a help. Perhaps Browning
regarded the action which can be exhibited on the
stage as something external to the soul, and imagined
that the naked spirit can be viewed more intimately
than the spirit clothed in deed and in circumstance.
If this was so, his conceptions were somewhat crude;
with the true dramatic poet action is the hieroglyph
of the soul, and many a secret may be revealed in this
language, amassing as it does large meanings into one
luminous symbol, which cannot be set forth in an
elaborate intellectual analysis. We think to probe
<a name="Page_24"></a>the depths, and perhaps never get far below the
surface. But the flash and outbreak of a fiery spirit,
amid a tangle of circumstance, springs to the surface
from the very centre, and reveals its inmost energies.</p>
<p>Paracelsus, as presented in the poem, is a man of
pre-eminent genius, passionate intellect, and inordinate
intellectual ambition. If it is meant that he
should be the type of the modern man of science,
Browning has missed his mark, for Paracelsus is in
fact almost as much the poet as the man of science;
but it is true that the cautious habits of the inductive
student of nature were rare among the enthusiastic
speculators of Renaissance days, and the Italian successor
of Paracelsus&#8212;Giordano Bruno&#8212;was in reality,
in large measure, what Browning has here conceived
and exhibited. Paracelsus is a great revolutionary
spirit in an epoch of intellectual revolution; it is
as much his task to destroy as to build up; he has
broken with the past, and gazes with wild-eyed hopes
into the future, expecting the era of intellectual liberty
to dawn suddenly with the year One, and seeing in
himself the protagonist of revolution. Such men as
Paracelsus, whether their sphere be in the political,
the religious, or the intellectual world, are men of
faith; a task has been laid on each of them; a
summons, a divine mandate, has been heard. But is
the summons authentic? is the mandate indeed
divine? In the quiet garden at W&uuml;rzburg, while
the autumn sun sinks behind St Saviour's spire, Festus&#8212;the
faithful Horatio to this Hamlet of science&#8212;puts
his questions and raises his doubts first as to the end
and aim of Paracelsus, his aspiration towards absolute
knowledge, and secondly, as to the means proposed
<a name="Page_25"></a>for its attainment&#8212;means which reject the service
of
all predecessors in the paths of knowledge; which
depart so widely from the methods of his contemporaries;
which seek for truth through strange and casual
revelations; which leave so much to chance. Very
nobly has Browning represented the overmastering
force of that faith which genius has in itself, and
which indeed is needed to sustain it in the struggle
with an incredulous or indifferent world. The end
itself is justified by the mandate of God; and as for
the means, truth is not to be found only or chiefly by
gathering up stray fragments from without; truth
lies buried within the soul, as jewels in the mine, and
the chances and changes and shocks of life are required
to open a passage for the shining forth of this
inner light. Festus is overpowered less by reason
than by the passion of faith in his younger and greater
fellow-student; and the gentle Michal is won from her
prophetic fears half by her affectionate loyalty to the
man, half by the glow and inspiration of one who
seems to be a surer prophet than her mistrusting self.
And in truth the summons to Paracelsus is authentic;
he is to be a torch-bearer in the race. His errors are
his own, errors of the egoism of genius in an age of
intellectual revolution; he casts away the past, and
that is not wise, that is not legitimate; he anticipates
for himself the full attainment of knowledge, which
belongs not to him but to humanity during revolving
centuries; and although he sets before himself the
service of man as the outcome of all his labours&#8212;and
this is well&#8212;at the same time he detaches himself
from his fellow-men, regards them from a regal height,
would decline even their tribute of gratitude, and
<a name="Page_26"></a>would be the lofty benefactor rather than the
loving
helpmate of his brethren. Is it meant then that
Paracelsus ought to have contented himself with being
like his teacher Trithemius and the common
masters of the schools? No, for these rested with
an easy self-satisfaction in their poor attainments, and
he is called upon to press forward, and advance from
strength to strength, through attainment or through
failure to renewed and unending endeavour. His
dissatisfaction, his failure is a better thing than their
success and content in that success. But why should
he hope in his own person to forestall the slow advance
of humanity, and why should the service of the
brain be alienated from the service of the heart?</p>
<p>There are many ways in which Browning could
have brought Paracelsus to a discovery of his error.
He might have learnt from his own experience the
aridity of a life which is barren of love. Some
moment of supreme pity might have come to him,
in which he, the possessor of knowledge, might have
longed to offer consolation to some suffering fellow,
and have found the helplessness of knowledge to
console. Browning's imagination as a romantic poet
craved a romantic incident and a romantic <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i>.
In the house of the Greek conjuror at Constantinople,
Paracelsus, now worn by his nine years' wanderings,
with all their stress and strain, his hair already
streaked with grey, his spirit somewhat embittered
by the small success attending a vast effort, his moral
nature already somewhat deteriorated and touched
with the cynicism of experience and partial failure,
shall encounter the strange figure of Aprile, the living
wraith of a poet who has also failed, who "would love
<a name="Page_27"></a>infinitely and be loved," and who in gazing upon
the
end has neglected all the means of attainment; and
from him, or rather by a reflex ray from this Aprile,
his own error shall be flashed on the consciousness
of the foiled seeker for knowledge. The invention
of Browning is certainly not lacking in the quality of
strangeness in beauty; yet some readers will perhaps
share the feeling that it strains, without convincing,
the imagination. As we read the first speeches
addressed by the moon-struck poet to the wandering
student of science, and read the moon-struck replies,
notwithstanding the singular beauty of certain dramatic
and lyrical passages, we are inclined to ask&#8212;Is this,
indeed, a conjuror's house at Constantinople, or one
of Browning's "mad-house cells?" and from what
delusions are the harmless, and the apparently
dangerous, lunatic suffering? The lover here is
typified in the artist; but the artist may be as
haughtily isolated from true human love as the
man of science, and the fellowship with his kind which
Paracelsus needs can be poorly learnt from such a
distracted creature as Aprile. It is indeed Aprile's
example and the fate which has overtaken him rather
than his wild words which startle Paracelsus into a
recognition of his own error. But the knowledge
that he has left love out of his scheme of life is no
guarantee that he will ever acquire the fervour and
the infinite patience of love. The whole scene, with
its extravagant poetic beauties and high-pitched
rhetoric, leaves a painful impression of unreality, not
in the shallower but in the deepest sense of that
word.</p>
<p>For a poet to depict a poet in poetry is a hazardous
<a name="Page_28"></a>experiment; in regarding one's own trade a sense
of humour and a little wholesome cynicism are not
amiss. These could find no place in Browning's
presentation of Aprile, but it is certain that Browning
himself was a much more complex person than the dying
lover of love who became the instructor of Paracelsus.
When the scene shifts from Constantinople to Basil,
and the illustrious Professor holds converse with Festus
by the blazing logs deep into the night, and at length
morning arises "clouded, wintry, desolate and cold,"
we listen with unflagging attention and entire imaginative
conviction; and, when silence ensues, a wonder
comes upon us as to where a young man of three-and-twenty
acquired this knowledge of the various bitter
tastes of life which belong to maturer experience, and
how he had mastered such precocious worldly wisdom.
Paracelsus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The wondrous Paracelsus, life's dispenser,<br />
</span><span>Fate's commissary, idol of the schools<br />
</span><span>And courts,<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>chews upon his worldly success and extracts its acrid
juices. This is not the romantic melancholy of youth,
which dreams of infinite things, but the pain of manhood,
which feels the limitations of life, which can laugh at
the mockery of attainment, which is sensible of the
shame that dwells at the heart of glory, yet which
already has begun to hanker after the mean delights
of the world, and cannot dispense with the sorry
pleasures of self-degradation. The kind, calm Pastor
of Einsiedeln sees at first only the splendour that
hangs around the name of his early comrade, the
hero of his hopes. And Paracelsus for a while would
forbear with tender ruth to shatter his friend's illusion,
<a name="Page_29"></a>would veil, if that were possible, the canker
which has
eaten into his own heart. But in the tumult of old
glad memories and present griefs, it ceases to be
possible; from amid the crew of foolish praisers he
must find one friend having the fidelity of genuine
insight; he must confess his failure, and once for all
correct the prophecy of Michal that success would
come and with it wretchedness&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>I have not been successful, and yet am<br />
</span><span>Most miserable; 'tis said at last.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>A certain manly protectiveness towards Festus and
Michal, with their happy Aennchen and Aureole in
the quiet home at Einsiedeln, remains to Paracelsus;
there is in it now more than a touch of "the devotion
to something afar from the sphere of our sorrow."</p>
<p>When, driven from Basil as a quack amid the
hootings of the crowd, Paracelsus once again
"aspires"; but it is from a lower level, with energy
less certain, and with a more turbid passion. Upon
such soiled and draggled wings can he ever soar
again? His strength is the strength of fever; his
gaiety is wild and bitter; he urges his brain with
artificial stimulants. And he, whose need was love,
has learnt hatred and scorn. In his earlier quest for
truth he had parted with youth and joy; he had
grown grey-haired and lean-handed before the time.
Now, in his new scheme of life, he will not sever truth
from enjoyment; he will snatch at the meanest
delights; before death comes, something at least shall
thus be gained. And yet he has almost lost the
capacity for pleasures apart from those of a wolfish
hunger for knowledge; and he despises his baser aims
<a name="Page_30"></a>and his extravagant speeches. Could life only be
begun anew with temperate hopes and sane aspirings!
But he has given his pledges and will abide by them;
he must submit to be hunted by the gods to the end.
Before he parts from Festus at the Alsatian inn, a
softer mood overtakes him. Blinded by his own
passion, Paracelsus has had no sense to divine the
sorrow of his friend, and Festus has had no heart to
obtrude such a sorrow as this. Only at the last
moment, and in all gentleness, it must be told&#8212;Michal
is dead. In Browning's earliest poem Pauline
is no more than a name and a shadow. The creator
of Ottima and Colombe, of Balaustion and Pompilia
had much to tell of womanhood. Michal occupies,
as is right, but a small space in the history of
Paracelsus, yet her presence in the poem and her
silent withdrawal have a poignant influence. We
see her as maiden and hear of her as mother, her face
still wearing that quiet and peculiar light</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Like the dim circlet floating round a pearl.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>And now, as the strong men of Shakespeare's play
spoke of the dead Portia in the tent, Paracelsus and
Festus talk of the pastor of Einsiedeln's gentle wife.
Festus speaks in assured hope, Paracelsus in daring
surmise, of a life beyond the grave, and finally with
a bitter return upon himself from his sense of her
tranquillity in death:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>And Michal sleeps among the roots and dews,<br />
</span><span>While I am moved at Basil, and full of schemes<br />
</span><span>For Nuremberg, and hoping and despairing,<br />
</span><span>As though it mattered how the farce plays out,<br />
</span><span>So it be quickly played!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_31"></a>It is the last cry of his distempered egoism
before the
closing scene.</p>
<p>In the dim and narrow cell of the Hospital of St
Sebastian, where he lies dying, Paracelsus at last
"attains"&#8212;attains something higher than a Professor's
chair at Basil, attains a rapture, not to be expressed, in
the joy which draws him onward, and a lucid comprehension
of the past that lies behind. All night the faithful
Festus has watched beside the bed; the mind of the
dying man is working as the sea works after a
tempest, and strange wrecks of memory float past
in troubled visions. In the dawning light the clouds
roll away, a great calm comes upon his spirit, and he
recognises his friend. It is laid upon him, before he
departs, to declare the meaning of his life. This
life of his had been no farce or failure; in his
degree he has served mankind, and what <i>is</i> the service
of man but the true praise of God? He perceives
now the errors of the way; he had been dazzled by
knowledge and the power conferred by knowledge;
he had not understood God's plan of gradual evolution
through the ages; he had laboured for his race in
pride rather than in love; he had been maddened by
the intellectual infirmities, the moral imperfections of
men, whereas he ought to have recognised even in
these the capacities of a creature in progress to a
higher development. Now, at length, he can follow
in thought the great circle of God's creative energy,
ever welling forth from Him in vast undulations, ever
tending to return to Him again, which return Godwards
is already foretold in the nature of man by august
anticipations, by strange gleams of splendour, by
cares and fears not bounded by this our earth.</p>
<p><a name="Page_32"></a>Were <i>Paracelsus</i> a poem of late instead
of early
origin in Browning's poetical career, we should
probably have received no such open prophecy as
this. The scholar of the Renaissance, half-genius,
half-charlatan, would have casuistically defended or
apologised for his errors, and through the wreathing
mists of sophistry would have shot forth ever and
anon some ray of truth.</p>
<p>We receive from <i>Paracelsus</i> an impression of the
affluence of youth. There is no husbanding of resources,
and perhaps too little reserve of power.
Where the poet most abandons himself to his ardour
of thought and imagination he achieves his highest
work. The stress and tension of his enthusiasm are
perhaps too continuous, too seldom relieved by spaces
of repose. It is all too much of a Mazeppa ride;
there are times when we pray for a good quarter of an
hour of comfortable dulness, or at least of wholesome
bovine placidity. The laws of such a poem are wholly
determined from within. The only question we have
a right to ask is this&#8212;Has the poet adequately dealt
with his subject, adequately expressed his idea? The
division of the whole into five parts may seem to have
some correspondency with the five acts of a tragedy;
but here the stage is one of the mind, and the acts
are free to contract or to expand themselves as the
gale of thought or passion rises or subsides. If a
spiritual anemometer were invented it would be found
that the wind which drives through the poem maintains
often and for long an astonishing pace. The
strangely beautiful lyric passages interspersed through
the speeches are really of a slower movement than the
dramatic body of the poem; they are, by comparison,
<a name="Page_33"></a>resting-places. The perfumed closet of the song
of
Paracelsus in Part IV. is "vowed to quiet" (did
Browning ever compose another romanza as lulling as
this?), and the Maine glides so gently in the lyric of
Festus (Part V.) that its murmuring serves to bring
back sanity to the distracted spirit of the dying
Aureole. There are youthful excesses in <i>Paracelsus</i>;
some vague, rhetorical grandeurs; some self-conscious
sublimities which ought to have been oblivious of self;
some errors of over-emphasis; some extravagances of
imagery and of expression. The wonderful passage
which describes "spring-wind, as a dancing psaltress,"
passing over the earth, is marred by the presence of
"young volcanoes"</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i24">"cyclops-like<br />
</span><span>Staring together with their eyes on flame,"<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>which young volcanoes were surely the offspring of
the "young earthquake" of Byron. But these are, as
the French phrase has it, defects of the poem's qualities.
A few pieces of base metal are flung abroad unawares
together with the lavish gold.</p>
<p>A companion poem to <i>Paracelsus</i>&#8212;so described by
Browning to Leigh Hunt&#8212;was conceived by the poet
soon after the appearance of the volume of 1835.
When <i>Strafford</i> was published two years later, we learn
from a preface, afterwards omitted, that he had been
engaged on <i>Sordello</i>. Browning desired to complete
his studies for this poem of Italy among the scenes
which it describes. The manuscript was with him in
Italy during his visit of 1838; but the work was not
to be hastily completed. <i>Sordello</i> was published in
1840, five years after <i>Paracelsus</i>. In the chronological
order of Browning's poems, by virtue of the
<a name="Page_34"></a>date of origin, it lies close to the earlier
companion
piece; in the logical order it is the completion of a
group of poems&#8212;<i>Pauline, Paracelsus, Sordello</i>&#8212;which
treat of the perplexities, the trials, the failures, the
ultimate recovery of men endowed with extraordinary
powers; it is one more study of the conduct of genius
amid the dangers and temptations of life. Here we
may rightly disregard the order of publication, and
postpone the record of external incidents in Browning's
poetical development, in order to place <i>Sordello</i> in its
true position, side by side with <i>Paracelsus</i>.</p>
<p>How the subject of <i>Sordello</i> was suggested to
Browning we do not know; the study of Dante may
have led him to a re-creation of the story of Dante's
predecessor; after having occupied in imagination the
old towns of Germany and Switzerland&#8212;W&uuml;rzburg
and Basil, Colmar and Salzburg&#8212;he may have longed
for the warmth and colour of Italy; after the Renaissance
with its revolutionary speculations, he may have
wished to trace his way back to the Middle Age,
when men lived and moved under the shadow of one
or the other of two dominant powers, apparently fixed
in everlasting rivalry&#8212;the Emperor and the Pope.</p>
<p>"The historical decoration," wrote Browning, in the
dedicatory letter of 1863, to his friend Milsand, "was
purposely of no more importance than a background
requires; and my stress lay on the incidents in the
development of a soul: little else is worth study."
Undoubtedly the history of a soul is central in the
poem; but the drawings of Italian landscape, so sure
in outline, so vivid in colour; the views of old Italian
city life, rich in the tumult of townsfolk, military
chieftains, men-at-arms; the pictures of sombre interiors,
<a name="Page_35"></a>and southern gardens, the hillside castle amid
its vines,
the court of love with its contending minstrels, the
midnight camp lit by its fires; and, added to these,
the Titianesque portraits of portly magnifico and gold-haired
maiden, and thought-worn statist make up an
environment which has no inconsiderable poetic value
of its own, feeding, as it does, the inner eye with
various forms and dyes, and leaving the "spirit in
sense" more wealthy. With a theme so remote from
the common consciousness of his own day, Browning
conceived that there would be an advantage in being
his own commentator and interpreter, and hence he
chose the narrative in preference to the dramatic form;
thus, he supposed he could act the showman and stand
aside at times, to expound his own intentions. Unhappily,
in endeavouring to strengthen and concentrate
his style, he lost that sense of the reader's distance
from himself which an artist can never without risk
forget; in abbreviating his speech his utterance
thickened; he created new difficulties by a legerdemain
in the construction of sentences; he assumed
in his public an alertness of intelligence equal to his
own. When it needs a leaping-pole to pass from
subject to verb across the chasm of a parenthesis, when
a reader swings himself dubiously from relative to
some one of three possible antecedents, when he springs
at a meaning through the fissure of an undeveloped
exclamatory phrase, and when these efforts are demanded
again and again, some muscular fatigue naturally
ensues. Yet it is true that when once the right
connections in these perplexing sentences have been
established, the sense is flashed upon the mind with
singular vividness; then the difficulty has ceased to
<a name="Page_36"></a>exist. And thus, in two successive stages of
study,
the same reader may justly censure <i>Sordello</i> for its
obscurity of style, and justly applaud it for a remarkable
lucidity in swiftness. Intelligent, however, as
Browning was, it implied a curious lack of intelligence
to suppose that a poem of many thousand lines written
I in shorthand would speedily find decipherers. If we
may trust the words of Westland Marston, recorded
by Mr W.M. Rossetti in <i>The Preraphaelite Brotherhood
Journal</i> (26 February 1850), Browning imagined
that his shorthand was Roman type of unusual clearness:
"Marston says that Browning, before publishing
<i>Sordello</i>, sent it to him to read, saying that this time
I the public should not accuse him at any rate of being
unintelligible." What follows in the <i>Journal</i> is of interest,
but can hardly be taken as true to the letter:
"Browning's system of composition is to write down
on a slate, in prose, what he wants to say, and then
turn it into verse, striving after the greatest amount of
condensation possible; thus, if an exclamation will
suggest his meaning, he substitutes this for a whole
sentence." In climbing an antique tower we may
obtain striking flashes of prospect through the slits
and eyelet-holes which dimly illuminate the winding
stair, but to combine these into an intelligible landscape
is not always easy. Browning's errors of style
are in part attributable to his unhappy application of a
passage in a letter of Caroline Fox which a friend had
shown him. She stated that her acquaintance John
Sterling had been repelled by the "verbosity" of
<i>Paracelsus</i>: "Doth Mr Browning know," she asked,
"that Wordsworth will devote a fortnight or more to
the discovery of a single word that is the one fit for
<a name="Page_37"></a>his sonnet?"<a name="FNanchor_17"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Browning was determined to
avoid
"verbosity"; but the method which seems to have
occurred to him was that of omitting many needful
though seemingly insignificant words, and jamming
together the words that gleam and sparkle; with the
result that the mind is at once dazzled and fatigued.</p>
<p>Sordello, the Italian singer of the thirteenth century,
is conceived by Browning as of the type which he had
already presented in the speaker of <i>Pauline</i>, only that
here the poet is not infirm in will, and, though loved by
Palma, he is hardly a lover. Like the speaker of <i>Pauline</i>
he is preoccupied with an intense self-consciousness, the
centre of his own imaginative creations, and claiming
supremacy over these. He craves some means of
impressing himself upon the world, some means of
deploying the power that lies coiled within him, not
through any gross passion for rule but in order that he
may thus manifest himself to himself at the full. He
is as far as possible removed from that type of the
worshipping spirit exhibited in Aprile, and in the poet
Eglamor, whom Sordello foils and subdues in the
contest of song. The fame as a singer which comes
suddenly to him draws Sordello out of his Goito solitude
to the worldly society of Mantua, and his experiences
of disillusion and half voluntary self-degradation
are those which had been faintly shadowed forth in
<i>Pauline</i>, and exhibited more fully&#8212;and yet with a
difference&#8212;in the Basil experiences of Paracelsus. Like
the poet of <i>Pauline</i>, after his immersion in worldliness,
Sordello again seeks solitude, and recovers a portion
of his higher self; but solitude cannot content one
who is unable to obtain the self-manifestation which
<a name="Page_38"></a>his nature demands without the aid of others who
may furnish an external body for the forces that lie
suppressed within him. Suddenly and unexpectedly
the prospect of a political career opens before him.
May it not be that he will thus obtain what he needs,
and find in the people the instrument of his own
thoughts, his passions, his aspirations, his imaginings,
his will? May not the people become the body in
which his spirit, with all its forces, shall incarnate
itself? Coming into actual acquaintance with the
people for the first time, the sight of their multiform
miseries, their sorrows, even their baseness lays hold
of Sordello; it seems as if it were they who were
about to make <i>him</i> their instrument, the voice through
which their inarticulate griefs should find expression;
he is captured by those whom he thought to capture.
By all his personal connections he is of the Imperial
party&#8212;a Ghibellin; but, studying the position of
affairs, he becomes convinced that the cause of the
Pope is one with the cause of the people. At this
moment vast possibilities of political power suddenly
widen upon his view; Sordello, the minstrel, a poor
archer's son, is discovered to be in truth the only son
of the great Ghibellin chieftain, Salinguerra; he is
loved by Palma, who, with her youth and beauty,
brings him eminent station, authority, and a passion
of devoted ambition on his behalf; his father flings
upon Sordello's neck the baldric which constitutes
him the Emperor's representative in Northern Italy.
The heart and brain of Sordello become the field of
conflict between fierce, contending forces. All that is
egoistic in his nature cries out for a life of pride and
power and joy. At best it is but little that he could
<a name="Page_39"></a>ever do to serve the suffering multitude. And yet
should he falter because he cannot gain for them the
results of time? Is it not his part to take the single
step in their service, though it can be no more than a
step? In the excitement of this supreme hour of
inward strife Sordello dies; but he dies a victor; like
Paracelsus he also has "attained"; the Imperial
baldric is found cast below the dead singer's feet.</p>
<p>This, in brief, is the "history of a soul" which
Browning has imagined in his <i>Sordello</i>. And the
conclusion of the whole matter can be briefly stated:
the primary need of such a nature as Sordello's&#8212;and
we can hardly doubt that Browning would have
assigned himself a place in the class to which the poet
of his imagination belongs&#8212;is that of a Power above
himself, which shall deliver him from egoism, and
whose loyal service shall concentrate and direct his
various faculties, and this a Power not unknown or
remote, but one brought near and made manifest; or,
in other words, it is the need of that which old religion
has set forth as God in Christ. Sordello in his final
decision in favour of true service to the people had,
like Paracelsus, given his best praise to God, had
given his highest pledge of loyalty to whatever is
Divine in life. And therefore, though he has failed
in all his high designs, his failure is in the end a
success. He, like Paracelsus, had read that bitter
sentence which declares that "collective man outstrips
the individual":&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"God has conceded two sights to a man&#8212;<br />
</span><span>One, of men's whole work, time's completed plan,<br />
</span><span>The other, of the minute's work, man's first<br />
</span><span>Step to the plan's completion."<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_40"></a>And the poor minute's work assigned him by the
divine law of justice and pity he accepts as his whole
life's task. It is true that though he now clearly sees
the end, he has not perhaps recognised the means.
If Sordello contemplated political action as his mode
of effecting that minute's work, he must soon have
discovered, were his life prolonged, that not thus can
a poet live in his highest faculty, or render his
worthiest service. The poet&#8212;and speaking in his own
person Browning makes confession of his faith&#8212;can
adequately serve his mistress, "Suffering Humanity,"
only as a poet. Sordello failed to render into song
the highest thoughts and aspirations of Italy; but
Dante was to follow and was not to fail. The
minstrel's last act&#8212;his renunciation of selfish power
and pleasure, his devotion to what he held to be the
cause of the people, the cause of humanity, was indeed
his best piece of poetry; by virtue of that act Sordello
was not a beaten man but a conqueror.</p>
<p>These prolonged studies&#8212;<i>Paracelsus, Sordello</i>, and,
on a more contracted scale, <i>Pauline</i>&#8212;each a study in
"the development of a soul," gain and lose through
the immaturity of the writer. He had, as yet, brought
only certain of his faculties into play, or, at least, he
had not as yet connected with his art certain faculties
which become essential characteristics of his later work.
There is no humour in these early poems, or (since
Naddo and the critic tribe of <i>Sordello</i> came to qualify
the assertion) but little; there is no wise casuistry, in
which falsehood is used as the vehicle of truth; the
psychology, however involved it may seem, is really
too simple; the central personages are too abstract&#8212;knowledge
and love and volition do not exhaust the
<a name="Page_41"></a>soul; action and thought are not here
incorporated
one with the other; a deed is not the interpreter of
an idea; an idea is first exhibited by the poet and the
deed is afterwards set forth as its consequence; the
conclusions are too patently didactic or doctrinaire;
we suspect that they have been motives determining
the action; our scepticism as to the disinterested
conduct of the story is aroused by its too plainly
deduced moral. We catch the powers at play which
ought to be invisible; we fiddle with the works of the
clock till it ceases to strike. Yet if only a part of
Browning's mind is alive in these early poems, the
faculties brought into exercise are the less impeded by
one another; the love of beauty is not tripped up by
a delight in the grotesque. And there is a certain
pleasure in attending to prophecy which has not learnt
to hide itself in casuistry. The analysis of a state of
mind, pursued in <i>Sordello</i> with an effort that is sometimes
fatiguing and not always successful, is presently
followed by a superb portrait&#8212;like that of
Salinguerra&#8212;painted by the artist, not the analyst, and so
admirable is it that in our infirmity we are tempted
to believe that the process of flaying and dissection
alters the person of a man or woman as Swift has
said, considerably for the worse.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_42"></a>Chapter III</h2>
<h2>The Maker of Plays</h2>
<p>The publication of <i>Paracelsus</i> did not gain for Browning
a large audience, but it brought him friends and
acquaintances who gave his life a delightful expansion
in its social relations. John Forster, the critic, biographer
and historian, then unknown to him, reviewed
the poem in the <i>Examiner</i> with full recognition of its
power and promise. Browning gratefully commemorated
a lifelong friendship with Forster, nearly a score
of years later, in the dedication of the 1863 edition
of his poetical works. Mrs Orr recites the names of
Carlyle, Talfourd, R. Hengist Horne, Leigh Hunt,
Procter, Monckton Milnes, Dickens, Wordsworth,
Landor, among those of distinguished persons who
became known to Browning at this period.<a name="FNanchor_18"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> His
"simple and enthusiastic manner" is referred to by the
actor Macready in his diary; "he looks and speaks
more like a youthful poet than any man I ever saw."
Browning's face was one of rare intelligence and full of
changing expression. He was not tall, but in early
years he was slight, was graceful in his movements,
<a name="Page_43"></a>and held his head high. His dark brown hair hung
in wavy masses upon his neck. His voice had in early
manhood a quality, afterwards lost, which Mr Sharp
describes as "flute-like, clear, sweet and resonant."
Slim, dark, and very handsome are the words chosen
by Mrs Bridell-Fox to characterise the youthful
Browning as he reappeared to her memory; "And&#8212;may
I hint it?"&#8212;she adds, "just a trifle of a dandy,
addicted to lemon-coloured kid gloves and such things,
quite 'the glass of fashion and the mould of form.'
But full of ambition, eager for success, eager for fame,
and, what is more, determined to conquer fame and to
achieve success." Yet the correct and conventional
Browning could also fire up for lawlessness&#8212;"frenetic
to be free." He was hail-fellow well-met, we are told&#8212;but
is this part of a Browning legend?&#8212;with tramps
and gipsies, and he wandered gladly, whether through
devout sympathy or curiosity of mood we know not,
into Little Bethels and other tents of spiritual Ishmael.</p>
<p>From Camberwell Browning's father moved to a
house at Hatcham, transporting thither his long rows
of books, together with those many volumes which lay
still unwritten in the "celle fantastyk" of his son.
"There is a vast view from our greatest hill," wrote
Browning; a vast view, though Wordsworth had
scorned the Londoner's hill&#8212;"Hill? <i>we</i> call that, such
as that, a <i>rise</i>." Here he read and wrote, enjoyed his
rides on the good horse "York," and cultivated friendship
with a toad in the pleasant garden, for he had a
peculiar interest, as his poems show, in creatures that
live a shy, mysterious life apart from that of man, and
the claim of beauty, as commonly understood, was not
needed to win his regard. Browning's eye was an
<a name="Page_44"></a>instrument made for exact and minute records of
natural phenomena. "I have heard him say," Mr
Sharp writes, "that at that time"&#8212;speaking of his
earlier years&#8212;"his faculty of observation would not
have appeared despicable to a Seminole or an Iroquois."
Such activity of the visual nerve differs widely from
the wise passiveness or brooding power of the Wordsworthian
mode of contemplation. Browning's life was
never that of a recluse who finds in nature and communion
with the anima mundi a counterpoise to the
attractions of human society. Society fatigued him,
yet he would not abandon its excitements. A mystic&#8212;though
why it should be so is hard to say&#8212;does
not ordinarily affect lemon-coloured kid gloves, as did
the Browning of Mrs Bridell-Fox's recollection. The
mysticism of Browning's temper of mind came not by
withdrawal from the throng of positive facts, but by
pushing through these to the light beyond them, or
by the perception of some spear-like shaft of light
piercing the denseness, which was serviceable as the
sheathe or foil. And of course it was among men
and women that he found suggestions for some of his
most original studies.</p>
<p>An introduction to Macready which took place at
Mr Fox's house towards the close of November 1835
was fruitful in consequences. A month later Browning
was Macready's guest at Elstree, the actor's resting-place
in the country. His fellow-traveller, then
unknown to him, in the coach from London was
John Forster; in Macready's drawing-room the poet
and his critic first formed a personal acquaintance.
Browning had for long been much interested in the
stage, but only as a spectator. His imagination now
<a name="Page_45"></a>turned towards dramatic authorship with a view to
theatrical performance. A play on a subject from
later Roman history, <i>Narses</i>, was thought of and was
cast aside. The success of Talfourd's <i>Ion</i>, after the
first performance of which (May 26, 1836) Browning
supped in the author's rooms with Macready, Wordsworth,
and Landor, probably raised high hopes of a
like or a greater success for some future drama of his
own. "Write a play, Browning," said Macready, as
they left the house, "and keep me from going to
America." "Shall it be historical or English?"
Browning questioned, as the incident is related by
Mrs Orr, "What do you say to a drama on Strafford?"
The life of Stafford by his friend Forster, just published,
which during an illness of the author had been revised
in manuscript by Browning, probably determined
the choice of a subject.</p>
<p>By August the poet had pledged himself to achieve
this first dramatic adventure. The play was produced
at Covent Garden on May 1st, 1837, by Macready,
who himself took the part of Strafford. Helen Faucit,
then a novice on the stage, gave an adequate rendering
of the difficult part of Lady Carlisle. For the rest,
the complexion of the piece, as Browning describes
it, after one of the latest rehearsals, was "perfect
gallows." Great historical personages were presented
by actors who strutted or slouched, who whimpered
or drawled. The financial distress at Covent Garden
forbade any splendour or even dignity of scenery or
of costumes.<a name="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
The text was considerably altered&#8212;and
<a name="Page_46"></a>not always judiciously&#8212;from that of the printed
play,
which had appeared before its production on the stage.
Yet on the first night <i>Strafford</i> was not damned, and
on the second it was warmly applauded.<a name="FNanchor_20"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> After the
fifth performance the wretched Pym refused to save
his mother England even once more, and the play
was withdrawn. Browning declared to his friends
that never again, as long as he might live, would
he write a play. Whining not being to his taste, he
averted his eyes and set himself resolutely to work
upon <i>Sordello</i>.</p>
<p>"I sail this morning for Venice," Browning wrote
to a friend on Good Friday, 1838. He voyaged as
sole passenger on a merchantman, and soon was
on friendliest terms with the rough kindly captain.
For the first fortnight the sea was stormy and
Browning suffered much; as they passed through the
Straits of Gibraltar, Captain Davidson aided him to
reach the deck, and a pulsing of home-pride&#8212;not
home-sickness&#8212;gave their origin to the patriotic
lines beginning, "Nobly, nobly Cape Saint Vincent
to the north-west died away." Under the bulwark of
the <i>Norham Castle</i>, off the African coast, when the
fancy of a gallop on his Uncle Reuben's horse suddenly
presented itself in pleasant contrast with the tedium
of the hours on shipboard, he wrote in pencil, on the
flyleaf of Bartoli's Simboli, that most spirited of poems
which tell of the glory of motion&#8212;<i>How they brought
the good news from Ghent to Aix</i>. The only adventure
<a name="Page_47"></a>of the voyage was the discovery of an Algerine
pirate
ship floating keel uppermost; it righted suddenly
under the stress of ropes from the <i>Norham Castle</i>,
and the ghastly and intolerable dead&#8212;Algerines and
Spaniards&#8212;could not scare the British sailors eager
for loot; at last the battered hulk was cast loose, and
its blackness was seen reeling slowly off "into the
most gorgeous and lavish sunset in the world."
Having visited Venice, Vicenza and Padua&#8212;cities
and mountain solitudes, which gave their warmth and
colour to his unfinished poem&#8212;Browning returned
home by way of Tyrol, the Rhine, Liege and
Antwerp. It was his first visit to Italy and was a
time of enchantment. Fifty years later he recalled
the memories of these early days when his delight had
something insubstantial, magical in it, and the vision
was half perceived with the eye and half projected
from within:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>How many a year my Asolo,<br />
</span><span>Since&#8212;one step just from sea to land&#8212;<br />
</span><span>I found you, loved yet feared you so&#8212;<br />
</span><span>For natural objects seemed to stand<br />
</span><span>Palpably fire-clothed!<a name="FNanchor_21"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a><br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Of evenings soon after his return to London Mrs
Bridell-Fox writes: "He was full of enthusiasm for
Venice, that Queen of Cities. He used to illustrate
his glowing descriptions of its beauties, the palaces,
the sunsets, the moonrises, by a most original kind
of etching. Taking up a bit of stray notepaper, he
would hold it over a lighted candle, moving the paper
about gently till it was cloudily smoked over, and
then utilising the darker smears for clouds, shadows,
<a name="Page_48"></a>water, or what not, would etch with a dry pen the
forms of lights on cloud and palace, on bridge or
gondola on the vague and dreamy surface he had
produced." The anticipations of genius had already
produced a finer etching than any of these, in those
lines of marvellous swiftness and intensity in <i>Paracelsus</i>,
which
describe Constantinople at the hour of sunset.</p>

<h5>MAIN STREET OF ASOLO, SHOWING BROWNING'S HOUSE.</h5>
<h5><i>From a drawing by</i> Miss D. NOYES.</h5>
<p>The publication of <i>Sordello</i> (1840) did not improve
Browning's position with the public. The poem was
a challenge to the understanding of an aspirant reader,
and the challenge met with no response. An excuse
for not reading a poem of five or six thousand lines
is grateful to so infirm and shortlived a being as man.
And, indeed, a prophet, if prudent, may do well to
postpone the privilege of being unintelligible until he
has secured a considerable number of disciples of both
sexes. The reception of <i>Sordello</i> might have disheartened
a poet of less vigorous will than Browning;
he merely marched breast forward, and let <i>Sordello</i> lie
inert, until a new generation of readers had arisen.
The dramas, <i>King Victor and King Charles</i> and <i>The
Return of the Druses</i> (at first named "Mansoor the
Hierophant") now occupied his thoughts. Short
lyrical pieces were growing under his hand, and
began to form a considerable group. And one
fortunate day as he strolled alone in the Dulwich
wood&#8212;his chosen resort of meditation&#8212;"the image
flashed upon him of one walking thus alone through
life; one apparently too obscure to leave a trace of
his or her passage, yet exercising a lasting though
unconscious influence at every step of it."<a name="FNanchor_22"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> In other
<a name="Page_49"></a>words Pippa had suddenly passed her poet in the
wood.</p>
<p>A cheap mode of issuing his works now in manuscript
was suggested to Browning by the publisher
Moxon. They might appear in successive pamphlets,
each of a single sheet printed in double-column, and
the series might be discontinued at any time if the
public ceased to care for it. The general title <i>Bells
and Pomegranates</i> was chosen; "beneath upon the
hem of the robe thou shalt make pomegranates of
blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the
hem thereof; and bells of gold between them round
about." Browning, as he explained to his readers
in the last number, meant to indicate by the title,
"Something like an alternation, or mixture, of music
with discoursing, sound with sense, poetry with
thought"&#8212;such having been, in fact, one of the
most familiar of the Rabbinical interpretations designed
to expound the symbolism of this priestly decoration
prescribed in "Exodus." From 1841 to 1846 the
numbers of <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i> successively
appeared; with the eighth the series closed. The
first number&#8212;<i>Pippa Passes</i>&#8212;was sold for sixpence;
when <i>King Victor and King Charles</i> was published in
the following year (1842), the price was raised to one
shilling. The third and the seventh numbers were
made up of short pieces&#8212;<i>Dramatic Lyrics</i> (1842),
<i>Dramatic Romances and Lyrics</i> (1845). <i>The Return
of the Druses</i> and <i>A Blot in the 'Scutcheon</i>&#8212;Numbers
4 and 5&#8212;followed each other in the same year 1843.
<i>Colombe's Birthday</i>&#8212;the only number which is known
to survive in manuscript&#8212;came next in order (1844).
The last to appear was that which included <i>Luna</i>,
<a name="Page_50"></a>Browning's favourite among his dramas, and <i>A
Soul's
Tragedy</i>.<a name="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
His sister, except in the instance of <i>Colombe</i>,
was Browning's amanuensis. On each title-page he is
named Robert Browning "Author of Paracelsus"&#8212;the
"wholly unintelligible" <i>Sordello</i> being passed over.
Talfourd, "Barry Cornwall," and John Kenyon (the
cousin of Elizabeth Barrett) were honoured with
dedications. In these pamphlets of Moxon, Browning's
wonderful apples of gold were certainly not presented
to the public in pictures or baskets of silver; yet the
possessor of the eight parts in their yellow paper
wrappers may now be congratulated. Only one of
the numbers&#8212;<i>A Blot in the 'Scutcheon</i>&#8212;attained the
distinction of a second edition, and this probably
because the drama as published was helped to a
comparative popularity by its representation on the
stage.</p>
<p>This tragedy of young love and death was written
hastily&#8212;in four or five days&#8212;for Macready. Browning
while at work on his play, as we learn from a letter of
Dante Rossetti to Allingham, was kept indoors by a

Forster read the tragedy aloud from the manuscript for
Dickens, who wrote of it with unmeasured enthusiasm
in a letter, known to Browning only when printed
after the lapse of some thirty years: "Browning's play
has thrown me into a perfect passion of sorrow....
I know no love like it, no passion like it, no moulding
<a name="Page_51"></a>of a splendid thing after its conception like
it." Things
had gone ill with Macready at Drury Lane, and when
the time for <i>A Blot in the 'Scutcheon</i> drew near it is
evident that he feared further losses and would gladly
have been released from his promise to produce the
play; but Browning failed to divine the true state of
affairs. The tragedy was read to the company by a
grotesque, wooden-legged and red-nosed prompter, and
it was greeted with laughter. To make amends,
Macready himself undertook to read it aloud, but he
declared himself unable, in the disturbed state of his
mind, to appear before the public: his part&#8212;that of
Lord Tresham&#8212;must be taken by Phelps. From certain
rehearsals Phelps was unavoidably absent through
illness. Macready who read his lines on these occasions,
now was caught by the play, and saw possibilities
in the part of Tresham which fired his imagination.
He chose, almost at the last moment, to displace his
younger and less distinguished colleague. Browning,
on the other hand, insisted that Phelps, having been
assigned the part, should retain it. To baffle Macready
in his design of presenting the play to the public in a
mutilated form, Browning, aided by his publisher,
had the whole printed in four-and-twenty hours.<a name="FNanchor_25"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> A
rupture of the long-standing friendship with Macready
followed, nor did author and actor meet again until
after the great sorrow of Browning's life. "Mr
Macready too"&#8212;writes Mrs Orr&#8212;"had recently lost
his wife, and Mr Browning could only start forward,
<a name="Page_52"></a>grasp the hand of his old friend, and in a voice
choked
with emotion say, 'O Macready!'"</p>
<p>The tragedy was produced at Drury Lane on
February nth, 1843, with Phelps, who acted admirably
as Tresham, and Helen Faucit as Mildred.
Although it had been ill rehearsed and not a shilling
had been spent on scenery or dresses, it was received
with applause. To a call for the author, Browning, seated
in his box, declined to make any response. Thus,
not without some soreness of heart, closed his direct
connection with the theatre. He heard with pleasure
when in Italy that <i>A Blot in the 'Scutcheon</i> was given
by Phelps at Sadler's Wells Theatre in November
1848, and with unquestionable success. A rendering
of <i>Colombe's Birthday</i> was projected by Charles Kean
in 1844, but the long delays, which were inevitable,
could not be endured by Browning, who desired to
print his play forthwith among the <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i>.
It was not until nine years later that this
play, a veritable "All for love, or the world well lost,"
was presented at the Haymarket, Helen Faucit appearing
as the Duchess. Soon after <i>Colombe's Birthday</i>
had been published, Browning sailed once more, in
the autumn of 1844, for Italy.<a name="FNanchor_26"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> As he journeyed
northwards and homewards, from Naples (where they
were performing an opera named <i>Sordello</i>) and Rome
he sought and obtained at Leghorn an interview with
Trelawny, the generous-hearted friend of Shelley, by
whose grave he had lately stood.<a name="FNanchor_27"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>
<p><a name="Page_53"></a>Browning's work as a playwright, consisting of
eight
pieces, or nine if we include the later <i>In a Balcony</i>, is
sufficiently ample to enable us to form a trustworthy
estimate of his genius as seen in drama. Dramatic, in
the sense that he created and studied minds and
hearts other than his own, he pre-eminently was; if he
desired to set forth or to vindicate his most intimate
ideas or impulses, he effected this indirectly, by detaching
them from his own personality and giving
them a brain and a heart other than his own in which
to live and move and have their being. There is a
kind of dramatic art which we may term static, and
another kind which we may term dynamic. The
former deals especially with characters in position, the
latter with characters in movement.<a name="FNanchor_28"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> Passion and
thought may be exhibited and interpreted by dramatic
genius of either type; to represent passion and thought
and action&#8212;action incarnating and developing thought
and passion&#8212;the dynamic power is required. And by
action we are to understand not merely a visible deed,
but also a word, a feeling, an idea which has in it a direct
operative force. The dramatic genius of Browning was
in the main of the static kind; it studies with extraordinary
skill and subtlety character in position; it
attains only an imperfect or a laboured success with
character in movement. The <i>dramatis personae</i> are
ready at almost every moment, except the culminating
moments of passion, to fall away from action into
reflection and self-analysis. The play of mind upon
<a name="Page_54"></a>mind he recognises of course as a matter of
profound
interest and importance; but he catches the energy
which spirit transfers to spirit less in the actual moment
of transference than after it has arrived. Thought and
emotion with him do not circulate freely through a
group of persons, receiving some modification from
each. He deals most successfully with each individual
as a single and separate entity; each maintains his own
attitude, and as he is touched by the common influence
he proceeds to scrutinise it. Mind in these plays
threads its way dexterously in and out of action; it
is not itself sufficiently incorporated in action. The
progress of the drama is now retarded; and again,
as if the author perceived that the story had fallen
behind or remained stationary, it is accelerated by
sudden jerks. A dialogue of retrospection is a common
device at the opening of popular plays, with a view
to expound the position of affairs to the audience;
but a dramatic writer of genius usually works forward
through his dialogue to the end which he has set
before him. With Browning for the purpose of mental
analysis a dialogue of retrospection may be of higher
value than one which leans and presses towards the
future. The invisible is for him more important than
the visible; and so in truth it may often be; but
the highest dramatist will not choose to separate the
two. The invisible is best captured and is most
securely held in the visible.</p>
<p>As a writer of drama, Browning, who delights to
study the noblest attitudes of the soul, and to wring
a proud sense of triumph out of apparent failure, finds
his proper field in tragedy rather than in comedy.
<i>Colombe's Birthday</i> has a joyous ending, but the joy is
<a name="Page_55"></a>very grave and earnest, and the body of the play
is
made up of serious pleadings and serious hopes and
fears. There is no light-hearted mirth, no real gaiety
of temper anywhere in the dramas of Browning.
Pippa's gladness in her holiday from the task of silk-winding
is touched with pathos in the thought that
what is so bright <i>is</i> also so brief, and it is encompassed,
even within delightful Asolo, by the sins and sorrows
of the world. Bluphocks, with his sniggering wit and
his jingles of rhyme is a vagabond and a spy, who
only covers the shame of his nakedness with these rags
of devil-may-care good spirits. The genial cynicism
of Ogniben is excellent of its kind, and pleases the
palate like an olive amid wines; but this man of
universal intellectual sympathies is at heart the satirist
of moral illusions, the unmasker of self-deception, who
with long experience of human infirmities, has come
to chuckle gently over his own skill in dealing with
them; and has he not&#8212;we may ask&#8212;wound around
his own spirit some of the incurable illusions of worldly
wisdom? No&#8212;this is not gaiety; if Browning smiles
with his Ogniben, his smile is a comment upon the
weakness and the blindness of the self-deceiver.</p>
<p>Browning's tragedies are tragedies without villains.
The world is here the villain, which has baits and
bribes and snares wherewith to entangle its victims,
to lure down their mounting aspirations, to dull their
vision for the things far-off and faint; perhaps also
to make them prosperous and portly gentlemen, easy-going,
and amiably cynical, tolerant of evil, and
prudently distrustful of good. Yet truth is truth,
and fact is fact; worldly wisdom is genuine wisdom
after its kind; we shall be the better instructed if we
<a name="Page_56"></a>listen to its sage experience, if we listen,
understand,
and in all justice, censure. Ogniben can blandly and
skilfully conduct a Chiappino to his valley of
humiliation&#8212;"let him that standeth take heed lest he fall."
But what would the wisdom of Ogniben be worth in
its pronouncements on a Luria or a Colombe? Perhaps
even in such a case not wholly valueless. The self-pleased,
keen-sighted Legate might after all have
applauded a moral heroism or a high-hearted gallantry
which would ill accord with his own ingenious and
versatile spirit. Bishop Blougram&#8212;sleek, ecclesiastical
opportunist&#8212;was not insensible to the superior merits
of "rough, grand, old Martin Luther."</p>
<p>In Browning's nature a singularly keen, exploring
intelligence was united with a rare moral and spiritual
ardour, a passion for high ideals. In creating his
chief <i>dramatis persona</i> he distributes among them what
he found within himself, and they fall into two principal
groups&#8212;characters in which the predominating power
is intellect, and characters in which the mastery lies
with some lofty emotion. The intellect dealing with
things that are real and positive, those persons in whom
intelligence is supreme may too easily become the
children of this world; in their own sphere they are
wiser than the children of light; and they are skilled
in a moral casuistry by which they justify to themselves
the darkening of the light that is in them.
The passionate natures have an intelligence of their
own; they follow a gleam which is visible to them if
not to others; they discover, or rather they are discovered
by, some truth which flashes forth in one
inspired moment&#8212;the master-moment of a lifetime;
they possess the sublime certainty of love, loyalty,
<a name="Page_57"></a>devotion; if they err through a heroic folly and
draw
upon themselves ruin in things temporal, may there
not be some atom of divine wisdom at the heart of
the folly, which is itself indestructible, and which
ensures for them a welfare out of time and space?
Prophet and casuist&#8212;Browning is both; and to each
he will endeavour to be just; but his heart must give
a casting vote, and this cannot be in favour of the
casuist. Every self-transcending passion has in it a
divine promise and pledge; even the passion of the
senses if it has hidden within it one spark of self-annihilating
love may be the salvation of a soul. It
is Ottima, lifted above her own superb voluptuousness,
who cries&#8212;"Not me&#8212;to him, O God, be merciful."
The region of untrammelled, unclouded passion, of
spiritual intuition, and of those great words from
heaven, which pierce "even to the dividing asunder of
the joints and marrow," is, for Browning's imagination,
the East. The nations of the West&#8212;and, before all
others, the Italian race&#8212;are those of a subtly developed
intelligence. The worldly art of a Church-man,
ingenuities of theology having aided in refining
ingenuities of worldliness, is perhaps the finest exemplar
of unalloyed western brain-craft. But Italy is also a
land of passion; and therefore at once, for its ardours
of the heart&#8212;seen not in love alone but in carven
capital and on frescoed wall&#8212;and for its casuistries
of intellect, Browning looks to Italy for the material
best fitted to his artistry. Between that group of
personages whom we may call his characters of passion
and that group made up of his characters of intelligence,
lie certain figures of peculiar interest, by birth
and inheritance children of the East, and by culture
<a name="Page_58"></a>partakers, in a greater or a less degree, of the
characteristics
of the West&#8212;a Djabal, with his Oriental heart
entangled by Prankish tricks of sophistry; a Luria,
whose Moorish passion is enthralled by the fascination
of Florentine intellect, and who can make a return
upon himself with a half-painful western self-consciousness.</p>
<p>Loyalties, devotions, to a person, to a cause, to an
ideal, and the sacrifice of individual advantages, worldly
prosperity, temporal successes to these&#8212;such, stated
in a broad and general way, is the theme of special
interest to Browning in his dramas. These loyalties
may be well and wisely fixed, or they may contain a
portion of error and illusion. But in either case they
furnish a test of manly and womanly virtue. With a
woman the test is often proposed by love&#8212;by love as
set over against ease, or high station, or the pride of
power. Colombe of Ravestein is offered on the one
hand the restoration of her forfeited Duchy, the prospective
rank of Empress and partnership with a man,
who, if he cannot give love, is yet no ignoble wooer, a
man of honour, of intellect, and of high ambition; on
the other hand pleads the advocate of Cleves, a nameless
provincial, past his days of youth, lean and somewhat
worn, and burdened with the griefs and wrongs
of his townsfolk. Mere largeness in a life is something,
is much; but the quality of a life is more.
Valence has set the cause of his fellow-citizens above
himself; he has made the heart of the Duchess for
the first time thrill in sympathy with the life of her
people; he has placed his loyalty to her far above his
own hopes of happiness; he has urged his rival's
claims with unfaltering fidelity. It is not with any
<a name="Page_59"></a>backward glances of regret, any half-doubts,
prudent
reserves, or condescending qualifications that Colombe
gives herself to the advocate of the poor. She, in her
youth and beauty, has been happy during her year of
idlesse as play-Duchess of Juliers; she is happier now
as she abandons the court and, sure in her grave
choice, turns with a light and joyous laugh to welcome
the birthday gift of freedom and of love that has so
unexpectedly come to her. Having once made her
election, Colombe can throw away the world as gaily
as in some girlish frolic she might toss aside a rose.</p>
<p>The loyalty of men, their supreme devotion and
their test may, as with women, spring from the passion
of love; but other tests than this are often proposed
to them. With King Charles of Sardinia it is duty to
his people that summons him, from those modest and
tranquil ways of life of which he dreamed, to the cares
and toils of the crown. He has strength to accept
without faltering the burden that is laid upon him.
And if he falters at the last, and would resign to his
father, who reclaims it, the crown which God alone
should have removed, shall we assert confidently that
Browning's dramatic instinct has erred? The pity of
it&#8212;that his great father, daring in battle, profound in
policy, should stand before him an outraged, helpless
old man, craving with senile greed a gift from his son&#8212;the
pity of it revives an old weakness, an old instinct
of filial submission, in the heart of Charles. He has
tasked himself without sparing; he has gained the
affections of his subjects; he has conciliated a hostile
Europe; is not this enough? Or was it also in the
bond that he should tread a miserable father into the
dust? The test again of Luigi, in the third part of
<a name="Page_60"></a><i>Pippa Passes</i>, is that of one who sees all
the oppression
of his people, who is enamoured of the antique
ideal of liberty, and whose choice lies between a youth
of luxurious ease and the virtue of one heroic crime,
to be followed by the scaffold-steps, with youth cut
short. To him that overcometh and endureth unto
the end will God give the morning-star:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The gift of the morning-star! Have I God's
gift<br />
</span><span>Of the morning-star?<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>And Luigi will adventure forth&#8212;it may be in a kind
of divine folly&#8212;as a doomsman commissioned by God
to free his Italy. The devotion of Luria to Florence
is partly of the imagination, and perhaps it is touched
with something of illusion. But the actual Florence,
with her astute politicians, her spies who spy upon
spies, her incurable distrusts, her sinister fears, her
ingrained ingratitude, is clearly exposed to him before
the end. Shall he turn the army, which is as much
his own as the sword he wields, joined with the forces
of Pisa, against the beautiful, faithless city? Or will
his passionate loyalty endure the test? Luria withdraws
from life, but not until he has made every
provision for the victory of Florence over her enemy;
nor does he die a defeated man; his moral greatness
has subdued all envies and all distrusts; at the close
everyone is true to him:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The only fault's with time;<br />
</span><span>All men become good creatures: but so slow.<a
 name="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a><br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Once again in Browning's earliest play, the test for
the patriot Pym lies in the choice between two loyalties&#8212;one
<a name="Page_61"></a>to England and to freedom, the other to his early
friend and former comrade in politics. His faith in
Strafford dies hard; but it dies; he flings forward his
hopes for the grand traitor to England beyond the
confines of this life, and only the grieved unfaltering
justiciary remains. Browning's Pym is a figure neither
historically true nor dramatically effective; he is self-conscious
and sentimental, a patriot armed in paste-board
rhetoric. But the writer, let us remember, was
young; this was his first theatrical essay, and he was
somewhat showy of fine intentions. The loyalty of
Strafford to the King is too fatuous an instinct to
gain our complete sympathy. He rides gallantly into
the quicksand, knowing it to be such, and the quicksand,
as certainly as the worm of Nilus, will do its kind.
And yet though this is the vain romance of loyalty, in
it, as Browning conceives, lies the test of Strafford.
A self-renouncing passion of any kind is not so common
that we can afford to look on his king-worship with
scorn.</p>
<p>Over against these devotees of the ideal Browning
sets his worldlings, ranging from creatures as despicable
as the courtiers of Duchess Colombe to such men
of power and inexhaustible resource as the Nuncio
who confronts Djabal with his Druses, or the Papal
Legate whose easier and half-humorous task is to
dismiss to his private affairs at Lugo the four-and-twentieth
leader of revolt. To the same breed with
the courtiers of Colombe belong old Vane and Savile
of the court of Charles. To the same breed with the
Nuncio and the Legate, belongs Monsignor, who proves
himself more than a match for his hireling, the scoundrel
Intendant. In a happy moment Monsignor is startled
<a name="Page_62"></a>into indignant wrath; he does not exclaim with
the
Edmund of Shakespeare's tragedy "Some good I mean
to do before I die;" but his "Gag the villain!" is
a substantial contribution to the justice of our world.
Under the ennobling influence of Charles and his
Polyxena, the craft of D'Ormea is uplifted to a level
of real dignity; if he cannot quite attain the position
of a martyr for the truth, he becomes something better
than one who serves God at the devil's bidding. And
Braccio, plotter and betrayer, yet always with a certain
fidelity towards his mother-city, is won over to the
side of simple truth and righteousness by the overmastering
power of Luria's magnanimity. So precious,
after all&#8212;Browning would say&#8212;is the mere capacity
to recognise facts; if only a little grain of virtue
remains in the heart, this faculty of vision may make
some sudden discovery which shall prove to a worldling
that there exist facts, undeniable and of immense
potency, hitherto unknown to his philosophy of chicane.
Browning's vote is given, as has been said, and with
no uncertain voice, for his devotees of the ideal; but
the men of fine worldly brain-craft have a fascination
for him as they have for his Eastern Luria. In Djabal,
at once enthusiast and impostor, Browning may seem,
as often afterwards, to offer an apology for the palterer
with truth; but in the interests of truth itself, he
desires to study the strange phenomenon of the deceiver
who would fain half-deceive himself.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_63"></a>Chapter IV</h2>
<h2>The Maker of Plays&#8212;<i>(Continued)</i></h2>
<br />
<p>The women of the dramas, with one or two exceptions,
are composed of fewer elements than the men.
A variety of types is presented, but each personality
is somewhat constrained and controlled by its idea;
the free movement, the iridescence, the variety in oneness,
the incalculable multiplicity in unity, of real
character are not always present. They admit of
definition to a degree which places them at a distance
from the inexplicable open secrets of Shakespeare's
creation; they lack the simple mysteriousness, the
transparent obscurity of nature. With a master-key
the chambers of their souls can one after another be
unlocked. Ottima is the carnal passion of womanhood,
full-blown, dazzling in the effrontery of sin, yet
including the possibility, which Browning conceives as
existing at the extreme edge of every expansive ardour,
of being translated into a higher form of passion which
abolishes all thought of self. Anael, of <i>The Return of
the Druses</i>, is pure and measureless devotion. The
cry of "Hakeem!" as she falls, is not an act of faith
but of love; it pierces through the shadow of the
material falsehood to her one illuminated truth of
absolute love, like that other falsehood which sanctifies
the dying lips of Desdemona. The sin of Mildred is
the very innocence of sin, and does not really alter the
<a name="Page_64"></a>simplicity of her character; it is only the
girlish rapture
of giving, with no limitation, whatever may prove
a bounty to him whom she loves:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Come what, come will,<br />
</span><span>You have been happy.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The remorse of Mildred is the remorse of innocence,
the anguish of one wholly unlearned in the dark colours
of guilt. This tragedy of Mildred and Mertoun is the
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> of Browning's cycle of dramas. But
Mildred's cousin Guendolen, by virtue of her swift,
womanly penetration and her brave protectiveness of
distressed girlhood, is a kinswoman of Beatrice who
supported the injured daughter of Leonato in a comedy
of Shakespeare which rings with laughter.</p>
<p>Polyxena, the Queen of Sardinia&#8212;a daughter not
of Italy but of the Rhineland&#8212;is, in her degree, an
eighteenth century representative of the woman of the
ancient Teutonic tribes, grave, resolute, wise, and possessing
the authority of wisdom. She, whose heart and brain
work bravely together like loyal comrades, is strongly
but also simply, conceived as the helpmate, the counsellor,
and, in the old sense of the word, the comforter
of her husband. Something of almost maternal feeling,
as happens at times in real life, mingles with her wifely
affection for Charles, who indeed may prove on occasions
a fractious son. Like a wise guardian-angel she
remembers on these occasions that he is only a man,
and that men in their unwisdom may grow impatient
of unalleviated guardian-angelhood; he will by and by
discover his error, and she can bide her time. Perhaps,
like other heroines of Browning, Polyxena is too
constantly and uniformly herself; yet, no doubt, it is
<a name="Page_65"></a>right that opaline, shifting hues should not
disturb our
impression of a character whose special virtue is steadfastness.
The Queen of the English Charles, who is
eager to counsel, and always in her petulance and
folly to counsel ill, is slightly sketched; but she may
be thanked for one admirable speech&#8212;her first&#8212;when
Strafford, worn and fevered in the royal service, has
just arrived from Ireland, and passing out from his
interview with the King is encountered by her:&#8212;</p>

<p>The Lady Carlisle of the same play&#8212;a creature in
the main of Browning's imagination&#8212;had the play
been Elizabethan or Jacobean would have followed
her lord in a page's dress, have lived on half a smile
a day, and perhaps have succeeded in dying languishingly
and happily upon his sword; she is not quite
unreal, nor yet quite real; something much better than
a stage property and not wholly a living woman;
more of a Beaumont and Fletcher personage of the
boards&#8212;and as such effective&#8212;than a Shakespearian
piece of nature. The theatrical limbo to which such
almost but not quite embodied shadows ultimately
troop, is capacious.</p>
<p>In Browning's dramatic scene of 1853, <i>In a Balcony</i>,
he created with unqualified success "a very woman"
in the enamoured Queen, whose heart at fifty years
beats only more wildly and desperately than a girl's.<a
 name="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
The young lovers, Constance and Norbert, are a highly
<a name="Page_66"></a>meritorious pair, who express their passion in
excellent
and eloquent periods; we have seen their like before,
and since. But the Queen, with her unslaked thirst
for the visionary wells under the palm-trees, who finds
herself still amid the burning sands, is an original and
tragic figure&#8212;a royal Mlle. de Lespinasse, and crowned
with fiery and immitigable pain. Although she has
returned the "glare" of Constance with the glare of
"a panther," the Queen is large-hearted. The guards,
it is true, arrive as the curtain falls; but those readers
who have wasted their tender emotion on a couple of
afflicted prisoners or decapitated young persons, whom
mother Nature can easily replace, are mistaken. If
the Queen does not die that night, she will rise next
morning after sleepless hours, haggard, not fifty but
eighty years old, and her passion will, heroically slay
itself in an act of generosity.<a name="FNanchor_31"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> Little more, however,
than a situation is represented in this dramatic scene.
Of Browning's full-length portraits of women in the
<a name="Page_67"></a>dramas, the finest piece of work is the portrait
of the
happiest woman&#8212;the play-Duchess of Juliers, no
longer Duchess, but ever</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Our lady of dear Ravestein.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Colombe is no incarnated idea but a complete
human being, irreducible to a formula, whom we know
the better because there is always in her more of
exquisite womanhood to be discovered. Even the
too fortunate Valence&#8212;all readers of his own sex
must pronounce him too fortunate&#8212;will for ever be
finding her anew.</p>
<p>In the development of his dramatic style Browning
more and more lost sight of the theatre and its requirements;
his stage became more and more a stage
of the mind. <i>Strafford</i>, his first play, is the work of a
novice, who has little of the instinct for theatrical
effect, but who sets his brain to invent striking tableaux,
to prepare surprises, to exhibit impressive attitudes,
to calculate&#8212;not always successfully&#8212;the angle of
a speech, so that it may with due impact reach the
pit. The opening scene expounds the situation. In
the second Wentworth and Pym confront each other;
the King surprises them; Wentworth lets fall the
hand of Pym, as the stage tradition requires; as
Wentworth withdraws the Queen enters to unmake
what he has made, and the scene closes with a tableau
expressing the sentimental weakness of Charles:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Come, dearest!&#8212;look, the little fairy, now<br />
</span><span>That cannot reach my shoulder! Dearest, come!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>And so proceeds the tragedy, with much that ought
to be dear to the average actor, which yet is somehow
not always even theatrically happy. The pathos of
<a name="Page_68"></a>the closing scene where Strafford is discovered
in The
Tower, sitting with his children, is theatrical pathos
of the most correct kind, and each little speech of
little William and little Anne is uttered as much for
the audience as for their father, implying in every
word "See, how we, poor innocents, heighten the pity
of it." The hastily written <i>A Blot in the 'Scutcheon</i>
is, perhaps, of Browning's dramas the best fitted for
theatrical representation. Yet it is incurably weak in
the motives which determine the action; and certain
passages are almost ludicrously undramatic. If
Romeo before he flung up his ladder of ropes had
paused, like Mertoun, to salute his mistress with a
tenor morceau from the opera, it is to be feared that
runaways' and other eyes would not have winked,
and that old Capulet would have come upon the
scene in his night-gown, prepared to hasten the
catastrophe with a long sword. Yet <i>A Blot in the
'Scutcheon</i>, with its breadth of outline, its striking
situations, and its mastery of the elementary passions&#8212;love
and wrath and pride and pity&#8212;gives us
assurance that Browning might have taken a place
of considerable distinction had he been born in an
age of great dramatic poetry. If it is weak in construction
so&#8212;though in a less degree&#8212;are Webster's
<i>Duchess of Malfi</i>, and Shakespeare's <i>Cymbeline</i>.</p>
<p>In <i>King Victor and King Charles</i> Browning adopted,
and no doubt deliberately, a plain, unfigured and uncoloured
style, as suiting both the characters and the
historical subject. The political background of this
play and that of <i>Strafford</i> hardly entitles either drama
to be named political. Browning was a student of
history, but it was individuals and not society that
<a name="Page_69"></a>interested him. The affairs of England and the
affairs
of Sardinia serve to throw out the figures of the chief
<i>dramatis persons</i>; those affairs are not considered for
their own sake. Certain social conditions are studied
as they enter into and help to form an individual.
The Bishop who orders his tomb at St Praxed's is
in part a product of the Italian Renaissance, but the
causes are seen only in their effects upon the character
of a representative person. If the plain, substantial
style of <i>King Victor and King Charles</i> is proper to a
play with such a hero as Charles and such a heroine
as Polyxena, the coloured style, rich in imagery, is no
less right in <i>The Return of the Druses</i>, where religious
and chivalric enthusiasm are blended with the enthusiasm
of the passion of love. But already Browning
was ceasing to bear in mind the conditions of the stage.
Certain pages where Djabal and Khalil, Djabal and
Anael, Anael and Loys are the speakers, might be described
as dialogues conducted by means of "asides,"
and even the imagination of a reader resents a construction
of scenes which requires these duets of soliloquies,
these long sequences of the audible-inaudible.
With the "very tragical mirth" of the second part of
Chiappino's story of moral and political disaster, the
spectators and the stage have wholly disappeared from
Browning's theatre; the imaginary dialogue is highly
dramatic, in one sense of the word, and is admirable
in its kind, but we transport ourselves best to
the market-place of Faenza by sitting in an easy
chair.</p>
<p><i>Pippa Passes</i> is singular in its construction; scenes
detached, though not wholly disconnected, are strung
pendant-wise upon the gold thread, slender but suffi<a name="Page_70"></a>ciently
strong, of an idea; realism in art, as we now
call it, hangs from a fine idealism; this substantial
globe of earth with its griefs, its grossnesses, its
heroism, swings suspended from the seat of God.
The idea which gives unity to the whole is not a
mere fantasy. The magic practised by the unconscious
Pippa through her songs is of that genuine
and beautiful kind which the Renaissance men of
science named "Magia Naturalis." It is no fantasy
but a fact that each of us influences the lives of others
more or less every day, and at times in a peculiar
degree, in ways of which we are not aware. Let this
fact be seized with imaginative intensity, and let the
imagination render it into a symbol&#8212;we catch sight
of Pippa with her songs passing down the grass-paths
and under the pine-wood of Asolo. Her only service
to God on this one holiday of a toilsome year is to be
glad. She misconceives everything that concerns
"Asolo's Four Happiest Ones"&#8212;to her fancy Ottima
is blessed with love, Jules is no victim of an envious
trick, Luigi's content in his lot is deep and unassailable,
and Monsignor is a holy and beloved priest;
and, unawares to her, in modes far other than she had
imagined, each of her dreams comes true; even
Monsignor for one moment rises into the sacred
avenger of God. Her own service, though she knows
it not, is more than a mere twelve-hours' gladness;
she, the little silk-winder, rays forth the influences of
a heart that has the potency ascribed to gems of
unflawed purity; and such influences&#8212;here embodied
in the symbol of a song&#8212;are among the precious
realities of our life. Nowhere in literature has the
virtue of mere innocent gladness been more charm<a name="Page_71"></a>ingly
imagined than in her morning outbreak of
expectancy, half animal glee, half spiritual joy; the
"whole sunrise, not to be suppressed" is a limitless
splendour, but the reflected beam cast up from the
splash of her ewer and dancing on her poor ceiling
is the same in kind; in the shrub-house up the
hill-side are great exotic blooms, but has not
Pippa her one martagon lily, over which she queens
it? With God all service ranks the same, and she
shall serve Him all this long day by gaiety and
gratitude.</p>
<p><i>Pippa Passes</i> is a sequence of dramatic scenes, with
lyrics interspersed, and placed in a lyrical setting; the
figures dark or bright, of the painting are "ringed by
a flowery bowery angel-brood" of song. But before
his <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i> were brought to a close
Browning had discovered in the short monodrama,
lyrical or reflective, the most appropriate vehicle for
his powers of passion and of thought. Here a single
situation sufficed; characters were seen rightly in
position; the action of the piece was wholly internal;
a passion could be isolated, and could be either traced
through its varying moods or seized in its moment of
culmination; the casuistry of the brain could be
studied apart,&#8212;it might have its say uninterrupted, or
it might be suddenly encountered and dissipated by
some spearlike beam of light from the heart or soul;
the traditions of a great literary form were not here a
cause of embarrassment; they need not, as in work
for the theatre, be laboriously observed or injuriously
violated; the poet might assert his independence and
be wholly original.</p>
<p>And original, in the best sense of the word&#8212;entirely
<a name="Page_72"></a>true to his highest self&#8212;Browning was in the
"Dramatic Lyrics" of 1842, and the "Dramatic
Romances and Lyrics" of 1845. His senses were at
once singularly keen and energetic, and singularly
capacious of delight; his eyes were active instruments
of observation, and at the same time were possessed
by a kind of rapture in form&#8212;and not least in fantastic
form&#8212;and a rapture still finer in the opulence and
variety of colour. In these poems we are caught into
what may truly be called an enthusiasm of the senses;
and presently we find that the senses, good for their
own sakes, are good also as inlets to the spirit.
Having returned from his first visit to southern Italy,
the sights and sounds, striking upon the retina and
the auditory nerve, with the intensity of a new experience,
still attack the eye and ear <i>as</i> he writes his
<i>Englishman in Italy</i>, and by virtue of their eager
obsession demand and summon forth the appropriate
word.<a name="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
The fisherman from Amalfi pitches down
his basket before us,</p>

<p>Or it is the "quick rustle-down of the quail-nets,"
or the "whistling pelt" of the olives, when Scirocco is
loose, that invades our ears. And by and by among
the mountains the play of the senses expands, and the
soul has its great word to utter:</p>

</span></div>
</div>
<p>Not less vivid is the vision of the light craft with its
lateen sail outside Triest, in which Waring&#8212;the Flying
Englishman&#8212;is seen "with great grass hat and kerchief
black," looking up for a moment, showing his "kingly
throat," till suddenly in the sunset splendour the boat
veers weather-ward and goes off, as with a bound,
"into the rose and golden half of the sky." And what
animal-painter has given more of the leonine wrath in
mane and tail and fixed wide eyes than Browning has
conveyed into his lion of King Francis with three strokes
of the brush? Or it is only a bee upon a sunflower
on which the gazer's eye is fixed, and we get the word
of Rudel:</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
<p>Or&#8212;a grief to booklovers!&#8212;the same eye is occupied
by all the grotesquerie of insect life in the
revel over that unhappy tome lurking in the plum

creeps and crawls with beetle and spider, worm and
eft.<a name="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
Or it is night and moonlight by the sandy
shore, and for a moment&#8212;before love enters&#8212;all
the mind of the impressionist artist lives merely in
the eye:</p>

</span><span>In fiery ringlets from their sleep<br />
</span><span>As I gain the cove with pushing prow.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>If Browning did not rejoice in perfect health and
animal spirits&#8212;and in the letters to Miss Barrett we
hear of frequent headaches and find a reference to his
pale thin face as seen in a mirror&#8212;he had certainly
the imagination of perfect vitality and of those "wild
joys of living," sung by the young harper David in that
poem of <i>Saul</i>, which appeared as a fragment in the
<i>Bells and Pomegranates</i>, and as a whole ten years later,
with the awe and rapture of the spirit rising above
the rapture of the senses.<a name="FNanchor_34"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>
<p>Of these poems of 1842 and 1845 one <i>The Pied
Piper</i>, was written in the spirit of mere play and was
included in <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i> only to make up
a number, for which the printer required more copy.
One or two&#8212;the flesh and blood incarnations of the
wines of France and Hungary, <i>Claret</i> and <i>Tokay</i>, are
no more than clever caprices of the fancy. One, <i>The
Lost Lender</i>, remotely suggested by the conservatism
of Wordsworth's elder days, but possibly deflected by
some of the feeling attributed to Pym in relation to
Strafford of the drama, and certainly detached from
direct personal reference to Wordsworth, expresses
Browning's liberal sentiment in politics. One, the
stately <i>Artemis Prologuizes</i>, is the sole remaining fragment
of a classical drama, "Hippolytus and Aricia,"
composed in 1840, "much against my endeavour,"
<a name="Page_75"></a>wrote the poet,&#8212;a somewhat enigmatical
phrase&#8212;"while
in bed with a fever." A considerable number of
the poems may be grouped together as expressions or
demonstrations of various passions, central among which
is the passion of love. A few, and these conspicuous
for their masterly handling of novel themes, treat of
art, and the feeling for art as seen in the painter of
pictures or in the connoisseur. Nor is the interpretation
of religious emotion&#8212;though in a phase that may
be called abnormal&#8212;wholly forgotten.</p>
<p>With every passion that expands the spirit beyond
the bounds of self, Browning, as the dramas have made
evident to us, is in cordial sympathy. The reckless
loyalty, with its animal spirits and its dash of grief,
the bitterer because grief must be dismissed, of the
<i>Cavalier Tunes</i>, is true to England and to the time in
its heartiness and gallant bluffness. The leap-up of pride
and joy in a boy's heart at the moment of death in
his Emperor's cause could hardly be more intensely
imagined than it is in the poem of the French camp,
and all is made more real and vivid by the presence of
that motionless figure, intent on victory and sustaining
the weight of imperial anxieties, which yet cannot be
quite impassive in presence of a death so devoted.
And side by side with this poem of generous enthusiasm
is placed the poem of passion reduced to its extreme of
meanness, its most contracted form of petty spite and
base envy&#8212;the <i>Soliloquy in a Spanish Cloister</i>; a
grotesque insect, spitting ineffectual poison, is placed
under the magnifying-glass of the comic spirit, and is
discovered to be&#8212;a brother in religion! A noble
hatred, transcending personal considerations, mingles
with a noble and solemn love&#8212;the passion of country&#8212;in
<a name="Page_76"></a>the Italian exile's record of his escape from
Austrian pursuers; with the clear-obscure of his
patriotic melancholy mingles the proud recollection of
the Italian woman who was his saviour, over whose
conjectured happiness as peasant wife and peasant
mother the exile bows with a tender joy. The examples
of abnormal passion are two&#8212;that of the
amorous homicide who would set on one perfect
moment the seal of eternity, in <i>Porphyria's Lover</i>, and
that of the other occupier of the mad-house cells,
Johannes Agricola, whose passion of religion is pushed
to the extreme of a mystical antinomianism.</p>
<p>Browning's poems of the love of man and woman
are seldom a simple lyrical cry, but they are not on
this account the less true in their presentment of that
curious masquer and disguiser&#8212;Love. When love
takes possession of a nature which is complex, affluents
and tributaries from many and various faculties run
into the main stream. With Browning the passion is
indeed a regal power, but intellect, imagination, fancy
are its office-bearers for a time; then in a moment it
resumes all authority into its own hands, resolves of a
sudden all that is complex into the singleness of joy
or pain, fuses all that is manifold into the unity of its
own life and being. His dramatic method requires
that each single faculty should be seen in the environment
of a character, and that its operations should be
clothed more or less in circumstance. And since love
has its ingenuities, its fine-spun and far-flung threads
of association, its occult symbolisms, Browning knows
how to press into the service of the central emotion
objects and incidents and imagery which may seem
remote or curious or fantastic or trivial or even
<a name="Page_77"></a>grotesque. In <i>Rudel to the Lady of Tripoli</i>
love
which cometh by the hearing of the ear (for Rudel is
a sun-worshipper who has never seen his sun) is a pure
imaginative devotion to the ideal. In <i>Count Gismond</i>
love is the deliverer; the motive of the poem is
essentially that of the Perseus and Andromeda myth
refined upon and mediaevalised. In <i>Cristine</i> love is
the interpreter of life; a moment of high passion
explains, and explains away, all else that would obscure
the vision of what is best and most real in this
our world and in the worlds that are yet unattained.
From a few lines written to illustrate a Venetian
picture by Maclise <i>In a Gondola</i> was evolved. If
Browning was not entirely accurate in his topography
of Venice, he certainly did not fail in his sense of the
depth and opulence of its colour. Here the abandonment
to passion is relieved by the quaint ingenuities
and fancies of love that seeks a momentary refuge
from its own excess, and then returns more eagerly
upon itself; and the shadow of death is ever at hand,
but like the shadows of a Venetian painter it glows
with colour.</p>
<p>The motives of two narrative poems, <i>The Glove</i> and
<i>The Flight of the Duchess</i>, have much in common;
they lie in the contrast between the world of convention
and the world of reality. In each the insulter of
proprieties, the breaker of bounds is a woman; in
each the choice lies between a life of pretended love
and vain dignities and a life of freedom and true love;
and in each case the woman makes her glad escape
from what is false to what is true. In restating the
incident of the glove Browning brings into play his
casuistry, but casuistry is here used to justify a passion
<a name="Page_78"></a>which the poet approves, to elucidate, not to
obscure,
what he represents as the truth of the situation. <i>The
Flight of the Duchess</i> in part took its rise "from a line,
'Following the Queen of the Gipsies, O!'&#8212;the burden
of a song, which the poet, when a boy, heard a woman
singing on a Guy Fawkes' day." Some two hundred
lines were given to Hood for his magazine, at a time
when Hood needed help, and death was approaching
him. The poem was completed some months later.
It is written, like <i>The Glove</i>, in verse that runs for
swiftness' sake, and that is pleased to show its paces
on a road rough with boulder-like rhymes. The little
Duchess is a wild bird caged in the strangely twisted
wirework of artificial modes and forms. She is a
prisoner who is starved for real life, and stifles; the
fresh air and the open sky are good, are irresistible&#8212;and
that is the whole long poem in brief. Such a
small prisoner, all life and fire, was before many
months actually delivered from her cage in Wimpole
Street, and Robert Browning himself, growing in
stature amid his incantations, played the part of the
gipsy.</p>
<p>Another Duchess, who pined for freedom and never
attained it, has her cold obituary notice from her
bereaved Duke's lips in the <i>Dramatic Lyrics</i> of 1842.
<i>My Last Duchess</i> was there made a companion poem
to <i>Count Gismond</i>; they are the pictures of the bond-woman
and of the freed-woman in marriage. The
Italian Duchess revolts from the law of wifehood no
further than a misplaced smile or a faint half-flush,
betraying her inward breathings and beamings of the
spirit; the noose of the ducal proprieties is around
her throat, and when it tightens "then all smiles
<a name="Page_79"></a>stopped together." Never was an agony hinted with
more gentlemanly reserve. But the poem is remarkable
chiefly as gathering up into a typical representative
a whole phase of civilisation. The Duke is
Italian of Renaissance days; insensible in his egoistic
pride to the beautiful humanity alive before him; yet
a connoisseur of art to his finger-tips; and after all a
Duchess can be replaced, while the bronze of Glaus of
Innsbruck&#8212;but the glory of his possessions must not
be pressed, as though his nine hundred years old name
were not enough. The true gift of art&#8212;Browning in
later poems frequently insists upon this&#8212;is not for
the connoisseur or collector who rests in a material
possession, but for the artist who, in the zeal of
creation, presses through his own work to that unattainable
beauty, that flying joy which exists beyond
his grasp and for ever lures him forward. In <i>Pictor
Ignotus</i> the earliest study in his lives of the painters
was made by the poet. The world is gross, its touch
unsanctifies the sanctities of art; yet the brave audacity
of genius is able to penetrate this gross world
with spiritual fire. Browning's unknown painter is a
delicate spirit, who dares not mingle his soul with the
gross world; he has failed for lack of a robust faith,
a strenuous courage. But his failure is beautiful and
pathetic, and for a time at least his Virgin, Babe, and
Saint will smile from the cloister wall with their "cold,
calm, beautiful regard." And yet to have done otherwise
to have been other than this; to have striven
like that youth&#8212;the Urbinate&#8212;men praise so!
More remarkable, as the summary of a civilisation,
than <i>My Last Duchess</i>, is the address of the worldling
Bishop, who lies dying, to the "nephews" who are
<a name="Page_80"></a>sons of his loins. In its Paganism of
Christianity&#8212;which
lacks all the manly virtue of genuine Paganism&#8212;that
portion of the artistic Renaissance which leans
towards the world and the flesh is concentrated and
is given as in quintessential form. The feeble fingers
yet cling to the vanities of earth; the speaker babbles
not of green fields but of his blue lump of lapis-lazuli;
and the last word of all is alive only with senile
luxury and the malice of perishing recollection.</p>

<p> I had written the above&#8212;and I leave it as I wrote it&#8212;before I
noticed
the following quoted from the letter of a friend by Mrs Arthur Bronson
in her article Browning in Venice: "Browning seemed as full of dramatic
interest in reading 'In a Balcony' as if he had just written it for our
benefit. One who sat near him said that it was a natural sequence that
the step of the guard should be heard coming to take Norbert to his
doom,
as, with a nature like the queen's, who had known only one hour of joy
in her sterile life, vengeance swift and terrible would follow on the
sudden
destruction of her happiness. 'Now I don't quite think that,' answered
Browning, as if he were following out the play as a spectator. 'The
queen has a large and passionate temperament, which had only once been
touched and brought into intense life. She would have died by a knife
in her heart. The guard would have come to carry away her dead body.'
'But I imagine that most people interpret it as I do,' was the reply.
'Then,' said Browning, with quick interest, 'don't you think it would
be
well to put it in the stage directions, and have it seen that they were
carrying her across the back of the stage?'"</p>

<h2>Love and Marriage</h2>
<br />
<p>In 1841, John Kenyon, formerly a school-fellow of
Browning's father, now an elderly lover of literature
and of literary society, childless, wealthy, generous-hearted,
proposed to Browning that he should call
upon Elizabeth Barrett, Kenyon's cousin once removed,
who was already distinguished as a writer of ardent
and original verse. Browning consented, but the
poetess "through some blind dislike of seeing
strangers"&#8212;as she afterwards told a correspondent&#8212;declined,
alleging, not untruly, as a ground of refusal,
that she was then ailing in health.<a name="FNanchor_35"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> Three years
later Kenyon sent his cousin's new volumes of <i>Poems</i> as
a gift to Sarianna Browning; her brother, lately returned
from Italy, read these volumes with delight
and admiration, and found on one of the pages a
reference in verse to his "Pomegranates" of a kind
that could not but give him a vivid moment of
pleasure. Might he not relieve his sense of obligation
by telling Miss Barrett, in a letter, that he
admired her work? Mr Kenyon encouraged the suggestion,
and though to love and be silent might on
the whole have been more to Browning's liking, he
wrote&#8212;January 10, 1845&#8212;and writing truthfully he
<a name="Page_82"></a>wrote enthusiastically.<a name="FNanchor_36"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> Miss Barrett, never quite
recovered
from a riding accident in early girlhood, and
stricken down for long in both soul and body by the
shock of her brother's death by drowning, lay from
day to day and month to month, in an upper room
of her father's house in Wimpole Street, occupied,
upon her sofa, with her books and papers&#8212;her Greek
dramatists and her Elizabethan poets&#8212;shut out from
the world, with windows for ever closed, and with only
an occasional female visitor, to gossip of the social and
literary life of London. Never was a spirit of more
vivid fire enclosed within a tomb. The letter from
Browning, "the author of <i>Paracelsus</i> and King of the
mystics," threw her, she says, "into ecstasics." Her
reply has a thrill of pleasure running through its
graceful half-restraint, and she holds out a hope that
when spring shall arrive a meeting in the invalid
chamber between her and her new correspondent may
be possible.</p>

<h5>ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.<br />
<i>From a drawing in chalk by</i> FIELD TALFOURD <i>in the National
Portrait Gallery</i>.</h5>
<p>From the first a headlong yet delicate speed was in
her pen; from the first there was much to say. "Oh,
for a horse with wings!" Mr Browning, who had
praised her poems, must tell her their faults. He
must himself speak out in noble verse, not merely
utter himself through the masks of <i>dramatis personae</i>.
Can she, as he alleges, really help him by her sympathy,
by her counsel? Let him put ceremony aside
and treat her <i>en bon camerade</i>; he will find her "an
honest man on the whole." She intends to set about
knowing him as much as possible immediately. What
poets have been his literary sponsors? Are not the
critics wrong to deny contemporary genius? What
<a name="Page_83"></a>poems are those now in his portfolio? Is not
&AElig;schylus the divinest of divine Greek spirits? but
how inadequately her correspondent has spoken of
Dante! Shall they indeed&#8212;as he suggests&#8212;write
something together? And then&#8212;is he duly careful
of his health, careful against overwork? And is not
gladness a duty? to give back to the world the joy
that God has given to his poet? Though, indeed, to
lean out of the window of this House of Life is for
some the required, perhaps the happiest attitude.</p>
<p>And why&#8212;replies the second voice&#8212;lean out of
the window? His own foot is only on the stair.
Where are the faults of her poems, of which she had
inquired? Yes, he will speak out, and he is now
planning such a poem as she demands. But she it
is, who has indeed spoken out in her verse? In his
portfolio is a drama about a Moor of Othello's country,
one Luria, with strange entanglings among his Florentines.
See this, and this, how grandly it is said in
the Greek of Eschylus! But Dante, all Dante is in
his heart and head. And he has seen Tennyson face
to face; and he knows and loves Carlyle; and he has
visited Sorrento and trod upon Monte Calvano. Oh,
the world in this year 1845 must be studied, though
solitude is best. He has been "polking" all night,
and walked home while the morning thrushes piped;
and it is true that his head aches. She shall read
and amend his manuscript poems. To hear from
her is better than to see anybody else. But when
shall he see her too?</p>
<p>So proceed from January to May the letters of
Rudel and the still invisible Lady of Wimpole Street.
It was happy comradeship on her part, but on his
<a name="Page_84"></a>it was already love. His spirit had recognised,
had
touched, a spirit, which included all that he most
needed, and union with which would be the most
certain and substantial prize offered by life. There
was nothing fatuous in this inward assurance; it was
the simplest and most self-evidencing truth. The
word "mistrustful"&#8212;"do not see me as long as you are
mistrustful of"&#8212;with its implied appeal to her generous
confidence, precipitated the visit. How could she
be mistrustful? Of course he may come: but the
wish to do so was unwisely exorbitant. On the
afternoon of May 20th, 1845, Browning first set eyes
on his future wife, a little figure, which did not rise
from the sofa, pale ringleted face, great eager, wistfully
pathetic eyes. He believed that she was suffering
from some incurable disease of the spine, and that
whatever remained to her of life must be spent in this
prostrate manner of an invalid.</p>
<p>A movement of what can only be imperfectly described
as pity entered into his feeling for her: it was
less pity than the joy of believing that he could confer
as well as receive. But his first thought on leaving
was only the fear that he might have stayed too long
or might have spoken too loud. The visit was on
Tuesday. On Thursday, Browning wrote the only
letter of the correspondence which has been destroyed,
one which overflowed with gratitude, and was immediately
and rightly interpreted by the receiver as
tending towards an offer, implied here, but not expressed,
of marriage. It was read in pain and
agitation; her heart indeed, but not her will, was
shaken; and, after a sleepless night, she wrote words
effective to bar&#8212;as she believed&#8212;all further advance
<a name="Page_85"></a>in a direction fatal to his happiness. The
intemperate
things he had said must be wholly forgotten between
them; or else she will not see him again; friends,
comrades in the life of the intellect they might continue
to be. For once and once only Browning lied to
Miss Barrett, and he lied a little awkwardly; his
letter was only one of too boisterous gratitude; his
punishment&#8212;that of one infinitely her inferior&#8212;was
undeserved; let her return to him the offending letter.
Returned accordingly it was, and immediately destroyed
by the writer. In happier days, Miss Barrett hoped to
recover what then would have been added to a hoard
which she treasured; but, Browning could not preserve
the words which she had condemned.</p>
<p>Wise guardian-angels smile at each other, gently
and graciously, when a lover is commanded to withdraw
and to reappear in the character of a friend.
An incoming tide may seem for a while to pause;
but by and by we look and the rock is covered.
Browning very dutifully submitted and became a
literary counsellor and comrade. The first stadium
in the progress of his fortunes opened in January
and closed before the end of May; the second closed
at the end of August. To a friend Miss Barrett,
assured that he never could be more, might well
be generous; visits were permitted, and it was left
to Browning to fix the days; the postal shuttle threw
swift and swifter threads between New Cross, Hatcham,
and 50 Wimpole Street. The verse of Tennyson,
the novels of George Sand were discussed; her translations
from the Greek were considered; his manuscript
poems were left for her corrections; but transcription
must not weary him into headaches; she would
<a name="Page_86"></a>herself by and by act as an amanuensis. Each of
the correspondents could not rest happy until the
other had been proved to be in every intellectual and
moral quality the superior. Browning's praise could
not be withheld; it seemed to his friend&#8212;and she
wrote always with crystalline sincerity&#8212;to be an
illusion which humbled her. Glad memories of Italy,
sad memories of England and the invalid life were
exchanged; there is nothing that she can teach him&#8212;she
declares&#8212;except grief. And yet to him the day
of his visit is his light through the dark week. He is
like an Eastern Jew who creeps through alleys in the
meanest garb, destitute to all wayfarers' eyes, who yet
possesses a hidden palace-hall of marble and gold.
Even in matters ecclesiastical, the footsteps of the two
friends had moved with one consent; each of them
preferred a chapel to a church; each was Puritan in
a love of simplicity in the things of religion; each
disowned the Puritan narrowness, and the grey aridity
of certain schools of dissent. On June 14&#8212;with the
warranty of her published poem which had told of
flowers sent in a letter&#8212;Browning encloses in his
envelope a yellow rose; and again and again summer
flowers arrive bringing colour and sweetness into the dim
city room. Once Miss Barrett can report that she
has been out of doors, and with no fainting-fit, yet
unable to venture in the carriage as far as the Park;
still her bodily strength is no better than that of a
tired bird; she is moreover, years older than her friend
(the difference was in fact that between thirty-nine
and thirty-three); and the thunder of a July storm
has shaken her nerves. There is some thought of her
seeking health as far off as Malta or even Alexandria;
<a name="Page_87"></a>but her father will jestingly have it that there
is
nothing wrong with her except "obstinacy and dry
toast." Thus cordially, gladly, sadly, and always
with quick leapings of the indomitable flame of the
spirit, these letters of friend to friend run on
during the midsummer days. Browning was willing
and happy to wait; a confidence possessed
him that in the end he would be known fully and
aright.</p>
<p>On August 25th came a great outpouring of feeling
from Miss Barrett. She took her friend so far into
her confidence as to speak plainly of the household
difficulties caused by her father's autocratic temper.
The conversation was immediately followed by a letter
in which she endeavoured to soften or qualify the
impression her words had given, and her heart, now
astir and craving sympathy, led her on to write of her
most sorrowful and sacred memories&#8212;those connected
with her brother's death. Browning was deeply moved,
most grateful for her trust in him, but she had forbidden
him to notice the record of her grief. He
longed to return confidence with confidence, to tell
what was urgent in his heart. But the bar of three
months since had not been removed, and he hesitated
to speak. His two days' silence was unintelligible to
his friend and caused her inexpressible anxiety. Could
any words of hers have displeased him? Or was he
seriously unwell? She wrote on August 30th a little
letter asking "the alms of just one line" to relieve her
fears. When snow-wreaths are loosened, a breath will
bring down the avalanche. It was impossible to receive
this appeal and not to declare briefly, decisively,
his unqualified trust in her, his entire devotion, his
<a name="Page_88"></a>assured knowledge of what would constitute his
supreme happiness.</p>
<p>Miss Barrett's reply is perfect in its disinterested
safe-guarding of his freedom and his future good as
she conceived it. She is deeply grateful, but she
cannot allow him to empty his water-gourds into
the sand. What could she give that it would not
be ungenerous to give? Yet his part has not been
altogether the harder of the two. The subject must
be left. Such subjects, however, could not be left until
the facts were ascertained. Browning would not urge
her a step beyond her actual feelings, but he must
know whether her refusal was based solely on her view
of his supposed interests. And with the true delicacy
of frankness she admits that even the sense of her own
unworthiness is not the insuperable obstacle. No&#8212;but
is she not a confirmed invalid? She thought that
she had done living when he came and sought her out.
If he would be wise, all these thoughts of her must be
abandoned. Such an answer brought a great calm to
Browning's heart; he did not desire to press her
further; let things rest; it is for her to judge; if
what she regards as an obstacle should be removed,
she will certainly then act in his best interests; to
himself this matter of health creates no difficulty; to
sit by her for an hour a day, to write out what was
in him for the world, and so to save his soul, would
be to attain his ideal in life. What woman would not
be moved to the inmost depths by such words? She
insists that his noble extravagances must in no wise
bind him; but all the bitternesses of life have been
taken away from her; henceforth she is his for everything
except to do him harm; the future rests with
<a name="Page_89"></a>God and with him. And amid the letters containing
these grave sentences, so full of fate, first appears a
reference to the pet name of her childhood&#8212;the "Ba"
which is all that here serves, like Swift's "little
language," to indulge a foolish tenderness; and the
translator of <i>Prometheus</i> is able to put Greek characters
to their most delightful use in her "<span lang="el" title="o philtate"></span>&#969;
&#966;&#953;&#955;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#949;."</p>
<p>In love-poetry of the Middle Age the allegorical
personage named "Danger" plays a considerable part,
and it is to be feared that Danger too often signified
a husband. In Wimpole Street that alarming personage
always meant a father. Edward Moulton Barrett
was a man of integrity in business, of fortitude in
adversity, of a certain stern piety, and from the
superior position of a domestic autocrat he could even
indulge himself in occasional fiats of affection. We
need not question that there were springs of water in
the rock, and in earlier days they had flowed freely.
But now if at night he visited his ailing daughter's
room for a few minutes and prayed with her and for
her, it meant that on such an occasion she was not
too criminal to merit the pious intercession. If he
called her "puss," it meant that she had not recently
been an undutiful child of thirty-nine or forty years
old. A circus-trainer probably rewards his educated
dogs and horses with like amiable familiarities, and
he is probably regarded by his troupe with affection
mingled with awe. Mr Barrett had been appointed
circus-trainer by the divine authority of parentage.
No one visited 50 Wimpole Street, where there were
grown-up sons as well as daughters, without special
permission from the lord of the castle; he authorised
the visits of Mr Browning, the poet, being fondly
<a name="Page_90"></a>assured that Mr Browning's intentions were not
those
of a burglar, or&#8212;worse&#8212;an amorous knight-errant.
If any daughter of his conceived the possibility of
transferring her prime love and loyalty from himself
to another, she was even as Aholah and Aholibah who
doted upon the Assyrians, captains, and rulers clothed
most gorgeously, all of them desirable young men.
"If a prince of Eldorado" said Elizabeth Barrett to
her sister Arabel, "should come with a pedigree of
lineal descent from some signory in the moon in one
hand, and a ticket of good behaviour from the nearest
Independent chapel in the other&#8212;" "Why, even then,"
interrupted Arabel, "it would not <i>do</i>" One admirable
trait, however, Mr Moulton Barrett did possess&#8212;he
was nearly always away from home till six o'clock.</p>
<p>The design that Miss Barrett should winter abroad
was still under consideration, but the place now fixed
upon was Pisa. Suddenly, in mid-September, she finds
herself obliged to announce that "it is all over with
Pisa." Her father had vetoed the undutiful project,
and had ceased to pay her his evening visits; only
in his separate and private orisons were all her sins
remembered. To admit the fact that he did not love
her enough to give her a chance of recovery was
bitter, yet it could not be denied. Her life was now
a thing of value to herself, for it was precious to
another. She beat against the bars of her cage;
planned a rebellious flight; made inquiries respecting
ships and berths; but she could not travel alone; and
she would not subject either of her sisters to the
heavy displeasure of the ruler of the house. Robert
Browning held strong opinions on the duty of resisting
evil, and if evil assume the guise of parental
<a name="Page_91"></a>authority it is none the <i>less</i>&#8212;he
believed&#8212;to be
resisted. To submit to the will of another is often
easy; to act on one's own best judgment is hard;
our faculties were given us to put to use; to be
passively obedient is really to evade probation&#8212;so
with almost excessive emphasis Browning set forth a
cardinal article of his creed; but Elizabeth Barrett
was not, like him, "ever a fighter," and, after all,
London in 1845 was not bleak and grey as it had
been a year previously&#8212;"for reasons," to adopt a
reiterated word of the correspondence, "for reasons."</p>
<p>On two later occasions Browning sang the same
battle-hymn against the enemies of God and with a
little too much vehemence&#8212;not to say truculence&#8212;as
is the way with earnest believers. His gentler
correspondent could not tolerate the thought of
duelling, and she disapproved of punishment by death.
Browning argues that for one who values the good
opinion of society&#8212;not for himself&#8212;that good
opinion is a possession which may, like other possessions,
be defended at the risk of a man's life, and as
for capital punishment, is not evil to be suppressed at
any price? Is not a miscreant to be expelled out of
God's world? The difference of opinion was the first
that had arisen between the friends, and Browning's
words carried with them a certain sense of pain in the
thought that they could in any thing stand apart.
Happily the theoretical fire-eater had faith superior
to his own arguments;&#8212;faith in a woman's insight
as finer than his own;&#8212;and he is let off with a gratified
rebuke for preternatural submissiveness and for arraying
her in pontifical garments of authority which hang
loose upon so small a figure. The other application of
<a name="Page_92"></a>his doctrine of resisting evil was even more
trying to
her feelings and the preacher was instant certainly out
of season. Not the least important personage in the
Wimpole Street house was Miss Barrett's devoted
companion Flush. Loyal and loving to his mistress
Flushie always was; yet to his lot some canine errors
fell; he eyed a visitor's umbrella with suspicion; he
resented perhaps the presence of a rival; he did not
behave nicely to a poet who had not written verses
in his honour; for which he was duly rebuked by his
mistress&#8212;the punishment was not capital&#8212;and was
propitiated with bags of cakes by the intruder.
When the day for their flight drew near Miss Barrett
proposed somewhat timidly that her maid Wilson
should accompany her to Italy, but she was gratefully
confident that Flush could not be left behind. Just
at this anxious moment a dreadful thing befell; a
gang of dog-stealers, presided over by the arch-fiend
Taylor, bore Flushie away into the horror of some
obscure and vulgar London alley. He was a difficult
dog to capture and his ransom must be in proportion
to his resistance. There was a terrible tradition of a
lady who had haggled about the sum demanded and
had received her dog's head in a parcel. Miss Barrett
was eager to part with her six guineas and rescue her
faithful companion from misery. Was this an occasion
for preaching from ethical heights the sin of making
a composition with evil-doers? Yet Browning, still
"a fighter" and armed with desperate logic, must
needs declaim vehemently against the iniquity of such
a bargain. It is something to rejoice at that he was
dexterously worsted in argument, being compelled to
admit that if Italian banditti were to carry off his
"<a name="Page_93"></a>Ba," he would pay down every farthing he might
have in the world to recover her, and this before he
entered on that chase of fifty years which was not to
terminate until he had shot down with his own hand
the receiver of the infamous bribe.</p>
<p>The journey of Miss Barrett to Pisa having been
for the present abandoned, friendship, now acknowledged
to be more than friendship, resumed its
accustomed ways. Visits, it was agreed, were not
to be too frequent&#8212;three in each fortnight might
prudently be ventured; but Wednesday might have
to be exchanged for Thursday or Saturday for Monday,
if on the first elected day Miss Mitford&#8212;dear and
generous friend&#8212;threatened to come with her talk,
talk, talk, or Mrs Jameson with her drawings and art-criticism,
or some unknown lion-huntress who had
thrown her toils, or kindly Mr Kenyon, who knew of
Browning's visits, and who when he called would peer
through his all-scrutinising spectacles with an air of
excessive penetration or too extreme unconsciousness.
And there were times&#8212;later on&#8212;when an avalanche
of aunts and uncles would precipitate itself on Wimpole
Street&#8212;perspicacious aunts and amiable uncles who
were wished as far off as Seringapatam, and who
wrung from an impatient niece&#8212;to whom indeed
they were dear&#8212;the cry "The barbarians are upon
us." Miss Barrett's sisters, the gentle Henrietta, who
preferred a waltz to the best sermon of an Independent
minister, and the more serious Arabel, who preferred
the sermon of an Independent minister to the best
waltz, were informed of the actual state of affairs.
They were trustworthy and sympathetic; Henrietta
had special reasons of her own for sympathy; Captain
<a name="Page_94"></a>Surtees Cook, who afterwards became her husband,
might be discussing affairs with her in the drawing-room
at the same time that Mr Browning the poet&#8212;"the
man of the pomegranates" as he was named
by Mr Barrett&#8212;held converse on literature with
Elizabeth in the upper chamber. The household was
honeycombed with treasons.</p>
<p>For the humours of superficial situations and passing
incidents Miss Barrett had a lively sense, and she
found some relief in playing with them; but with a
nature essentially truthful like hers the necessity of
concealment was a cause of distress. The position
was no less painful to Browning, and in the end it
became intolerable. Yet while there were obstructions
and winding ways in the shallows, in the depths
were flawless truth and inviolable love. What sentimental
persons fancy and grow effusive over was here
the simplest and yet always a miraculous reality&#8212;"He
of the heavens and earth brought us together so
wonderfully, holding two souls in his hand."<a name="FNanchor_37"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> In the
most illuminating words of each correspondent no
merely private, or peculiar feeling is expressed; it is
the common wave of human passion, the common love
of man and woman, that here leaps from the depths to
the height, and over which the iris of beauty ever and
anon appears with&#8212;it is true&#8212;an unusual intensity.
And so in reading the letters we have no sense of
prying into secrets; there are no secrets to be discovered;
what is most intimate is most common;
only here what is most common rises up to its highest
point of attainment. "I never thought of being happy
through you or by you or in you even, your good was
<a name="Page_95"></a>all my idea of good, and <i>is</i>" "Let me be
too near to
be seen.... Once I used to be more uneasy, and to
think that I ought to <i>make</i> you see me. But Love
is better than sight." "I love your love too much.
And <i>that</i> is the worst fault, my beloved, I can ever
find in my love of <i>you</i>." These are sentences that
tell of what can be no private possession, being as
liberal and free as our light and air. And if the
shadow of a cloud appears&#8212;appears and passes away&#8212;it
is a shadow that has floated over many other
hearts beside that of the writer: "How dreadfully
natural it would be to me, seem to me, if you <i>did</i>
leave off loving me! How it would be like the sun's
setting ... and no more wonder. Only, more darkness."
The old exchange of tokens, the old symbolisms&#8212;a
lock of hair, a ring, a picture, a child's penholder&#8212;are
good enough for these lovers, as they had been
for others before them. What is diffused through
many of the letters is gathered up and is delivered
from the alloy of superficial circumstance in the
"Sonnets from the Portuguese." in reading which we
are in the presence of womanhood&#8212;womanhood
delivered from death by love and from darkness by;
light&#8212;as much as in that of an individual woman.
And the disclosure in poems and in letters being
without reserve affects us as no disclosure, but simply
as an adequate expression of the truth universal.</p>
<p>One obstacle to the prospective marriage was steadily
diminishing in magnitude; Miss Barrett, with a new
joy in life, new hopes, new interests, gained in health
and strength from month to month. The winter of
1845-46 was unusually mild. In January one day
she walked&#8212;walked, and was not carried&#8212;downstairs
<a name="Page_96"></a>to the drawing-room. Spring came early that year;
in the first week of February lilacs and hawthorn were
in bud, elders in leaf, thrushes and white-throats in full
song. In April Miss Barrett gave pledges of her
confidence in the future by buying a bonnet; a little
like a Quaker's, it seemed to her, but the learned pronounced
it fashionable. Early in May, that bonnet,
with its owner and Arabel and Flush, appeared in
Regent's Park, while sunshine was filtering through
the leaves. The invalid left her carriage, set foot
upon the green grass, reached up and plucked a little
laburnum blossom ("for reasons"), saw the "strange
people moving about like phantoms of life," and felt
that she alone and the idea of one who was absent
were real&#8212;"and Flush," she adds with a touch of
remorse, "and Flush a little too." Many drives and
walks followed; at the end of May she feloniously
gathered some pansies, the flowers of Paracelsus, and
this notwithstanding the protest of Arabel, in the
Botanical Gardens, and felt the unspeakable beauty of
the common grass. Later in the year wild roses were
found at Hampstead; and on a memorable day the
invalid&#8212;almost perfect in health&#8212;was guided by
kind and learned Mrs Jameson through the pictures
and statues of the poet Rogers's collection. On yet
another occasion it was Mr Kenyon who drove her to
see the strange new sight of the Great Western train
coming in; the spectators procured chairs, but the
rush of people and the earth-thunder of the engine
almost overcame Miss Barrett's nerves, which on a
later trial shrank also from the more harmonious
thunder of the organ of the Abbey. Sundays came
when she enjoyed the privilege of sitting if not in a
<a name="Page_97"></a>pew at least in the secluded vestry of a Chapel,
and
joining unseen in those simple forms of prayer and
praise which she valued most. Altogether something
like a miracle in the healing of the sick had been
effected.</p>
<p>Money difficulty there was none. Browning, it is
true, was not in a position to undertake the expenses
of even such a simple household economy as they
both desired. He was prepared to seek for any
honourable service&#8212;diplomatic or other&#8212;if that were
necessary. But Miss Barrett was resolved against
task-work which might divert him from his proper
vocation as a poet. And, thanks to the affection of
an uncle, she had means&#8212;some &pound;400 a year, capable
of considerable increase by re-investment of the
principal&#8212;which were enough for two persons who
could be content with plain living in Italy. Browning
still urged that he should be the bread-winner; he
implored that her money should be made over to her
own family, so that no prejudice against his action
could be founded on any mercenary feeling; but she
remained firm, and would consent only to its transference
to her two sisters in the event of his death.
And so the matter rested and was dismissed from the
thoughts of both the friends.</p>
<p>Having the great patience of love, Browning would
not put the least pressure upon Miss Barrett as to the
date of their marriage; if waiting long was for her
good, then he would wait. But matters seemed tending
towards the desired end. In January he begged
her to "begin thinking"; before that month had
closed it was agreed that they should look forward
to the late summer or early autumn as the time of
<a name="Page_98"></a>their departure to Italy. Not until March would
Miss
Barrett permit Browning to fetter his free will by any
engagement; then, to satisfy his urgent desire, she
declared that she was willing to chain him, rivet him&#8212;"Do
you feel how the little fine chain twists round and
round you? do you hear the stroke of the riveting?"
But the links were of a kind to be loosed if need be at
a moment's notice. June came, and with it a proposal
from a well-intentioned friend, Miss Bayley, to accompany
her to Italy, if, by and by, such a change of abode
seemed likely to benefit her health. Miss Barrett was
prepared to accept the offer if it seemed right to
Browning, or was ready, if he thought it expedient, to
wait for another year. His voice was given, with such
decision as was possible, in favour of their adhering to
the plan formed for the end of summer; they both
felt the present position hazardous and tormenting;
to wear the mask for another year would suffocate
them; they were "standing on hot scythes."</p>
<p>Accordingly during the summer weeks there is
much poring over guide-books to Italy; much weighing
of the merits of this place of residence and of that.
Shall it be Sorrento? Shall it be La Cava? or Pisa?
or Ravenna? or, for the matter of that, would not
Seven Dials be as happy a choice as any, if only they
could live and work side by side? There is much
balancing of the comparative ease and the comparative
cost of routes, the final decision being in favour of
reaching Italy by way of France. And as the time
draws nearer there is much searching of time-tables, in
the art of mastering which Robert Browning seems
hardly to have been an expert. May Mr Kenyon be
told? Or is it not kinder and wiser to spare him the
<a name="Page_99"></a>responsibility of knowing? Mrs Jameson, who had
made a friendly proposal similar to that of Miss
Bayley,&#8212;may she be half-told? Or shall she be
invited to join the travellers on their way? What
books shall be brought? What baggage? And how
may a box and a carpet bag be conveyed out of 50
Wimpole Street with least observation?</p>
<p>It was deeply repugnant to Miss Barrett's feelings
to practise reserve on such a matter as this with her
father. Her happier companion had informed his
father and mother of their plans, and had obtained
from the elder Mr Browning a sum of money, asked
for as a loan rather than a gift, sufficient to cover the
immediate expenses of the journey. Mr Barrett was
entitled to all respect, and as for affection he received
from his daughter enough to make the appearance of
disloyalty to him carry a real pang to her heart. But
she believed that she had virtually no choice; her
nerves were not of iron; the roaring of the Great
Western express she might face but not an angry
father. A loud voice, and a violent "scene," such
as she had witnessed, until she fainted, when Henrietta
was the culprit, would have put an end to the Italian
project through mere physical collapse and ruin. Far
better therefore to withdraw quietly from the house,
and trust to the effect of a subsequent pleading in all
earnestness for reconciliation.</p>

<h5>Yours very truly, Robert Browning. <i>From an
engraving by</i> J.G. ARMYTAGE.</h5>
<p>As summer passed into early autumn the sense of
dangers and difficulties accumulating grew acute.
"The ground," wrote Browning, "is crumbling from
beneath our feet with its chances and opportunities."
In one of the early days of August a thunder-storm
with torrents of rain detained him for longer than
<a name="Page_100"></a>usual at Wimpole Street; the lightning was the
lesser
terror of the day, for in the evening entered Mr
Barrett to his daughter with disagreeable questioning,
and presently came the words&#8212;accompanied by a
gaze of stern displeasure&#8212;"It appears that <i>that man</i>
has spent the whole day with you." The louring
cloud passed, but it was felt that visits to be prudent
must be rare; for the first time a week went by
without a meeting. Early in September George
Barrett, a kindly brother distinguished by his constant
air of dignity and importance, was commissioned to
hire a country house for the family at Dover or Reigate
or Tunbridge, while paperers and painters were to busy
themselves at Wimpole Street. The moment for
immediate action had come; else all chance of Italy
might be lost for the year 1846. "We must be
married directly," wrote Browning on the morning
when this intelligence arrived. Next day a marriage
license was procured. On the following morning,
Saturday, September 12th, accompanied by her maid
Wilson, Miss Barrett, after a sleepless night, left her
father's house with feet that trembled; she procured
a fly, fortified her shaken nerves with a dose of sal
volatile at a chemist's shop, and drove to Marylebone
Church, where the marriage service was celebrated in
the presence of two witnesses. As she stood and
knelt her central feeling was one of measureless trust,
a deep rest upon assured foundations; other women
who had stood there supported by their nearest
kinsfolk&#8212;parents or sisters&#8212;had one happiness she
did not know; she needed it less because she was
happier than they.<a name="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
Then husband and wife parted.
<a name="Page_101"></a>Mrs Browning drove to the house of her blind
friend,
Mr Boyd, who had been made aware of the engagement.
On his sitting-room sofa she rested and sipped
his Cyprus wine; by and by arrived her sisters with
grave faces; the carriage was driven to Hampstead
Heath for the soothing happiness of the autumnal air
and sunshine; after which the three sisters returned
to their father's house; the wedding-ring was regretfully
taken off; and the prayer arose in Mrs Browning's
heart that if sorrow or injury should ever follow upon
what had happened that day for either of the two, it
might all fall upon her.</p>
<p>Browning did not again visit at 50 Wimpole Street;
it was enough to know that his wife was well, and
kept all these things gladly, tremblingly, in her heart.
For himself he felt that come what might his life had
"borne flower and fruit."<a name="FNanchor_39"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> On the Monday week
which succeeded the marriage the Barrett family were
to move to the country house that had been taken at
Little Bookham. On Saturday afternoon, a week
having gone by since the wedding, Mrs Browning and
Wilson, left what had been her home. Flush was
warned to make no demonstration, and he behaved
with admirable discretion. It was "dreadful" to
cause pain to her father by a voluntary act; but
another feeling sustained her:&#8212;"You <i>only</i>! As if one
said <i>God only</i>. And we shall have <i>Him</i> beside, I pray
of Him." At Hodgson's, the stationer and bookseller's,
they found Browning, and a little later husband and
wife, with the brave Wilson and the discreet Flush,
were speeding from Vauxhall to Southampton, in good
time to catch the boat for Havre. A north wind blew
<a name="Page_102"></a>them vehemently from the English coast. In the
newspaper announcements of the wedding the date
was to be omitted, and Browning rejected the suggestion
that on this occasion, and with reference to the
great event of his life, he should be defined to the
public as "the author of <i>Paracelsus</i>."</p>

<p>The letters from which this story has been drawn
have from first to last one burden; in them deep
answers to deep; they happily are of a nature to
escape far from the pedantries of literary criticism.
It cannot be maintained that Browning quite equals
his correspondent in the discovery of rare and exquisite
thoughts and feelings; or that his felicity in giving
them expression is as frequent as hers. Even on
matters of literature his comments are less original
than hers, less penetrating, less illuminating. Her wit
is the swifter and keener. When Browning writes to
afford her amusement, he sometimes appears to us,
who are not greatly amused, a little awkward and
laborious. She flashes forth a metaphor which
embodies some mystery of feeling in an image entirely
vital; he, with a habit of mind of which he was
conscious and which often influences his poetry, fastens
intensely on a single point and proceeds to muffle this
in circumstance, assured that it will be all the more
vividly apparent when the right instant arrives and
requires this; but meanwhile some staying-power is
demanded from the reader. Neither correspondent
has the art of etching a person or a scene in a few
decisive lines; the gift of Carlyle, the gift of Carlyle's
brilliant wife is not theirs, perhaps because acid is
<a name="Page_104"></a>needed to bite an etcher's plate. And, indeed,
many
of the minor notabilities of 1845, whose names appear
in these letters, might hardly have repaid an etcher's
intensity of selective vision. Among the groups of
spirits who presented themselves to Dante there were
some wise enough not to expect that their names
should be remembered on earth; such shades may
stand in a background. It is, however, strange that
Browning who created so many living men and women
should in his letters have struck out no swift indelible
piece of portraiture; even here his is the inferior
touch. And yet throughout the whole correspondence
we cannot but be aware that his is the more massive
and the more complex nature; his intellect has
hardier thews; his passion has an energy which
corresponds with its mass; his will sustains his passion
and projects it forward. And towards Miss Barrett
his strength is seen as gentleness, his energy as an
inexhaustible patience of hope.</p>
<p>When Browning and his wife reached Paris, Mrs
Browning was worn out by the excitement and fatigue.
By a happy accident Mrs Jameson and her niece were
at hand, and when the first surprise, with kisses to both
fugitives, was over, she persuaded them to rest for a
week where they were, promising, if they consented, to
be their companion and aider until they arrived at
Pisa. Their "imprudence," in her eyes, was "the
height of prudence"; "wild poets or not" they were
"wise people." The week at Paris was given up to
quietude; once they visited the Louvre, but the hours
passed for the most part indoors; it all seemed strange
and visionary&#8212;"Whether in the body or out of the
body," wrote Mrs Browning, "I cannot tell scarcely."
<a name="Page_105"></a>From Paris and Orleans they proceeded southwards
in weather, which, notwithstanding some rains, was delightful.
From Avignon they went on pilgrimage to
Petrarch's Vaucluse; Browning bore his wife to a rock
in mid stream and seated her there, while Flush scurried
after in alarm for his mistress. In the passage from
Marseilles to Genoa, Mrs Browning was able to sit
on deck; the change of air, although gained at the
expense of some weariness, had done her a world
of good.</p>
<p>Early in October the journeying closed at Pisa.
Rooms were taken for six months in the great
Collegio Ferdinando, close to the Duomo and the
Leaning Tower, rooms not quite the warmest in
aspect. Mrs Jameson pronounced the invalid not
improved but transformed. The repose of the city,
asleep, as Dickens described it, in the sun and the
secluded life&#8212;a perpetual <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, but
one so happy&#8212;suited
both the wedded friends; days of cloudless
weather, following a spell of rain, went by in "reading
and writing and talking of all things in heaven and
earth, and a little besides; and sometimes even laughing
as if we had twenty people to laugh with us, or
rather <i>hadn't</i>." Their sole acquaintance was an Italian
Professor of the University; for three months they
never looked at a newspaper; then a loophole on the
world was opened each evening by the arrival of the
Si&egrave;cle. The lizards were silent friends of one poet,
and golden oranges gleamed over the walls to the
unaccustomed eyes of the other like sunshine gathered
into globes. They wandered through pine-woods and
drove until the purple mountains seemed not far off.
At the Lanfranchi Palace they thought of Byron, to
<a name="Page_106"></a>see a curl of whose hair or a glove from whose
hand,
Browning declares (so foolish was he and ignorant) he
would have gone farther than to see all Wordsworth,
Coleridge and Southey condensed in Rosicrucian
fashion into a vial. In the Campo Santo they listened
to a musical mass for the dead. In the Duomo they
heard the Friar preach. And early in the morning
their dreams were scattered by the harmonious clangour
of the church bells. "I never was happy before in
my life," wrote Mrs Browning. Her husband relieved
her of all housekeeping anxieties. At two o'clock
came a light dinner&#8212;perhaps thrushes and chianti&#8212;from
the <i>trattoria</i>; at six appeared coffee and milk-rolls;
at nine, when the pine-fire blazed, roast chestnuts
and grapes. Debts there were none to vex the spirits
of these prudent children of genius. If a poet could
not pay his butcher's and his baker's bills, Browning's
sympathies were all with the baker and the butcher.
"He would not sleep," wrote his wife, "if an unpaid
bill dragged itself by any chance into another week ";
and elsewhere: "Being descended from the blood of
all the Puritans, and educated by the strictest of
dissenters, he has a sort of horror about the dreadful
fact of owing five shillings five days." Perhaps some
of this horror arose from the sense of that weight which
pecuniary cares hang upon all the more joyous mountings
of the mind. One grief and only one was still
present; Mr Barrett remained inexorable; his daughter
hoped that with time and patience his arms would
open to her again. It was a hope never to be fulfilled.
In the cordial comradeship of Browning's sister,
Sarianna, a new correspondent, there was a measure of
compensation.</p>
<p><a name="Page_107"></a>Already Browning had in view the collected
edition
of his Poetical Works which did not appear until
1849. The poems were to be made so lucid, "that
everyone who understood them hitherto" was to "lose
that mark of distinction." <i>Paracelsus</i> and <i>Pippa</i> were
to be revised with special care. The sales reported
by Moxon were considered satisfactory; but of course
the profits as yet were those of his wife's poems. "She
is," he wrote to his publisher, "there as in all else, as
high above me as I would have her."</p>
<p>It was at Pisa that the highest evidence of his wife's
powers as a poet came as an unexpected and wonderful
gift to her husband. In a letter of December
1845&#8212;more than a year since&#8212;she had confessed
that she was idle; and yet "silent" was a better
word she thought than "idle." Her apology was
that the apostle Paul probably did not work hard at
tent-making during the week that followed his hearing
of the unspeakable things. At the close of a letter
written on July 22, 1846, she wrote: "You shall see
some day at Pisa what I will not show you now.
Does not Solomon say that 'there is a time to read
what is written?' If he doesn't, he ought." The
time to read had now come. "One day, early in
1847," as Mr Gosse records what was told to him by
Browning, "their breakfast being over, Mrs Browning
went upstairs, while her husband stood at the window
watching the street till the table should be cleared.
He was presently aware of someone behind him,
although the servant was gone. It was Mrs Browning
who held him by the shoulder to prevent his turning
to look at her, and at the same time pushed a packet
of papers into the pocket of his coat. She told him
<a name="Page_108"></a>to read that, and to tear it up if he did not
like it;
and then she fled again to her own room." The
papers were a transcript of those ardent poems which
we know as "Sonnets from the Portuguese." Some
copies were printed at Reading in 1847 for private
circulation with the title "Sonnets by E.B.B." The
later title under which they appeared among Mrs
Browning's Poems in the edition of 1850 was of
Browning's suggestion. His wife's proposal to name
them "Sonnets from the Bosnian" was dismissed
with words which allude to a poem of hers, "Catarina
to Camoens," that had long been specially dear to
him: "Bosnian, no! that means nothing. From the
Portuguese: they are Catarina's sonnets!"</p>
<p>Pisa with all its charm lacked movement and animation.
It was decided to visit Florence in April, and
there enjoy for some days the society of Mrs Jameson
before she left Italy. The coup&eacute; of the diligence was
secured, and on April 20th Mrs Jameson's "wild poets
but wise people" arrived at Florence. An excellent
apartment was found in the Via delle Belle Donne
near the Piazza Santa Maria Novella, and for
Browning's special delight a grand piano was hired.
When Mrs Browning had sufficiently recovered strength
to view the city and its surroundings her pleasure was
great: "At Pisa we say, 'How beautiful!' here we
say nothing; it is enough if we can breathe." They
had hoped for summer wanderings in Northern Italy;
but Florence held them throughout the year except
for a few days during which they attempted in vain
to find a shelter from the heat among the pines of
Vallombrosa. Provided with a letter of recommendation
to the abbot they set forth from their rooms at
<a name="Page_109"></a>early morning by vettura and from Pelago
onwards,
while Browning rode, Mrs Browning and Wilson in
basket sledges were slowly drawn towards the
monastery by white bullocks. A new abbot, a little
holy man with a red face, had been recently installed,
who announced that in his nostrils "a petticoat stank."
Yet in the charity of his heart he extended the three
days ordinarily permitted to visitors in the House of
Strangers to five; during which period beef and oil,
malodorous bread and wine and passages from the
"Life of San Gualberto" were vouchsafed to heretics
of both sexes; the mountains and the pinewoods in
their solemn dialect spoke comfortable words.</p>
<p>"Rolling or sliding down the precipitous path" they
returned to Florence in a morning glory, very merry,
says Mrs Browning, for disappointed people. Shelter
from the glare of August being desirable, a suite of
comparatively cool rooms in the Palazzo Guidi were
taken; they were furnished in good taste, and opened
upon a terrace&#8212;"a sort of balcony terrace which ...
swims over with moonlight in the evenings." From
Casa Guidi windows&#8212;and before long Mrs Browning
was occupied with the first part of her poem&#8212;something
of the life of Italy at a moment of peculiar
interest could be observed. Europe in the years 1847
and 1848 was like a sea broken by wave after wave
of Revolutionary passion. Browning and his wife
were ardently liberal in their political feeling; but
there were differences in the colours of their respective
creeds and sentiments; Mrs Browning gave away her
imagination to popular movements; she was also
naturally a hero-worshipper; she hoped more enthusiastically
than he was wont to do; she was more readily
<a name="Page_110"></a>depressed; the word "liberty" for her had an
aureole
or a nimbus which glorified all its humbler and more
prosaic meanings. Browning, although in this year
1847 he made a move towards an appointment as
secretary to a mission to the Vatican, at heart cared
little for men in groups or societies; he cared greatly
for individuals, for the growth of individual character.
He had faith in a forward movement of society; but
the law of social evolution, as he conceived it, is not in
the hands of political leaders or ministers of state.
He valued liberty chiefly because each man here on
earth is in process of being tested, in process of being
formed, and liberty is the condition of a man's true
probation and development. Late in life he was
asked to give his answer to the question: "Why am I
a Liberal?" and he gave it succinctly in a sonnet
which he did not reprint in any edition of his Works,
although it received otherwise a wide circulation. It
may be cited here as a fragment of biography:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"Why?" Because all I haply can and do,<br />
</span><span>All that I am now, all I hope to be,&#8212;<br />
</span><span>Whence comes it save from fortune setting free<br />
</span><span>Body and soul the purpose to pursue,<br />
</span><span>God traced for both? If fetters, not a few,<br />
</span><span>Of prejudice, convention, fall from me,<br />
</span><span>These shall I bid men&#8212;each in his degree<br />
</span><span>Also God-guided&#8212;bear, and gladly too?<br />
</span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span>But little do or can the best of us:<br />
</span><span>That little is achieved through Liberty.<br />
</span><span>Who then dares hold&#8212;emancipated thus&#8212;<br />
</span><span>His fellow shall continue bound? Not I<br />
</span><span>Who live, love, labour freely, nor discuss<br />
</span><span>A brother's right to freedom. That is "Why."<a
 name="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a><br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_111"></a>This is an excellent reason for the faith
that was in
Browning; he holds that individual progress depends
on individual freedom, and by that word he understands
not only political freedom but also emancipation
from intellectual narrowness and the bondage of injurious
convention. But Browning in his verse, setting
aside the early <i>Strafford</i>, nowhere celebrates a popular
political movement; he nowhere chaunts a paean, in
the manner of Byron or Shelley, in honour of the
abstraction "Liberty." Nor does he anywhere study
political phenomena or events except as they throw
light upon an individual character. Things and
persons that gave him offence he could summarily
dismiss from his mind&#8212;"Thiers is a rascal; I make
a point of not reading one word said by M. Thiers";
"Proudhon is a madman; who cares for Proudhon?"
"The President's an ass; <i>he</i> is not worth thinking of."<a
 name="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
This may be admirable economy of intellectual force;
but it is not the way to understand the course of
public events; it does not indicate a political or a
historical sense. And, indeed, his writings do not
show that Browning possessed a political or a
historical sense in any high degree, save as a representative
person may be conceived by him as embodying
a phase of civilisation. When Mrs Trollope called
at Casa Guidi, Browning was only reluctantly present;
she had written against liberal institutions and against
the poetry of Victor Hugo, and that was enough.
Might it not have been more truly liberal to be patient
and understand the grounds of her prejudice?
"Blessed be the inconsistency of men!" exclaimed
Mrs Browning, for whose sake he tolerated the
<a name="Page_112"></a>offending authoress until by and by he came to
like
in her an agreeable woman.</p>
<p>On the anniversary of their wedding day Browning
and his wife saw from their window a brilliant procession
of grateful and enthusiastic Florentines stream
into the <i>Piazza</i>. Pitti with banners and <i>vivas</i> for the
space of three hours and a half It was the time
when the Grand Duke was a patriot and Pio Nono
was a liberal. The new helmets and epaulettes of
the civic guard proclaimed the glories of genuine
freedom. The pleasure of the populace was like that
of children, and perhaps it had some serious feeling
behind it. The incomparable Grand Duke had
granted a liberal constitution, and was led back from
the opera to the Pitti by the torchlights of a cheering
crowd&#8212;"through the dark night a flock of stars
seemed sweeping up the piazza." A few months later,
and the word of Mrs Browning is "Ah, poor Italy";
the people are attractive, delightful, but they want
conscience and self reverence.<a name="FNanchor_42"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> Browning and she
painfully felt that they grew cooler and cooler on
the subject of Italian patriotism. A revolution had
been promised, but a shower of rain fell and the
revolution was postponed. Now it was the Grand
Duke <i>out</i>, and the bells rang, and a tree of liberty
was planted close to the door of Casa Guidi; six
weeks later it was the Grand Duke <i>in</i>, and the same
bells rang, and the tree of liberty was pulled down.
The Pope is well-meaning but weak; and before
long honorific epithets have to be denied him&#8212;he is
merely a Pope; his prestige and power over souls is
lost. The liberal Grand Duke is transformed into a
<a name="Page_113"></a>Duke decorated with Austrian titles. As for
France,
Mrs Browning had long since learnt from the books
she read with so much delight to feel a debt to the
country of Balzac and George Sand. She thought
that the unrest and the eager hopes of the French
Revolution, notwithstanding its errors, indicated at
least the conception of a higher ideal than any known
to the English people. Browning did not possess an
equal confidence in France; he did not accept her
view that the French occupation of Rome was capable
of justification; nor did he enter into her growing
hero-worship&#8212;as yet far from its full development&#8212;of
Louis Napoleon. Her admiration for Balzac he
shared, and it is probable that the death of the great
novelist moved him to keener regret than did the
death, at no considerable distance of time, of Wordsworth.
With French communism or socialism neither
husband nor wife, however republican in their faith,
had sympathy; they held that its tendency is to
diminish the influence of the individual, and that in
the end the progress of the mass is dependent on
the starting forth from the mass and the striding
forward of individual minds. They believed as firmly
as did Edmund Burke in the importance of what
Burke styles a natural aristocracy.</p>
<p>For four years&#8212;from 1847 to 1851&#8212;Browning
never crossed the confines of Italy. No duties
summoned him away, and he was happy in his
home. "We are as happy," he wrote in December
1847, "as two owls in a hole, two toads under a
tree-stump; or any other queer two poking creatures
that we let live after the fashion of their black hearts,
only Ba is fat and rosy; yes indeed." In spring they
<a name="Page_114"></a>drove day by day through the Cascine, passing on
the
way the carven window of the <i>Statue and the Bust</i>,
and "the stone called Dante's," whereupon</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>He used to bring his quiet chair out, turned<br />
</span><span>To Brunelleschi's church.<a name="FNanchor_43"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a><br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>And after tea there was the bridge of Trinita from
which to watch the sunsets turning the Arno to pure
gold while the moon and the evening-star hung aloft.
It was a life of retirement and of quiet work. Mrs
Browning mentions to a friend that for fifteen months
she could not make her husband spend a single evening
out&#8212;"not even to a concert, nor to hear a play of
Alfieri's," but what with music and books and writing
and talking, she adds, "we scarcely know how the
days go, it's such a gallop on the grass." The
"writing" included the revision and preparation for
the press of Browning's <i>Poems</i>, in two volumes, which
Chapman &amp; Hall, more liberal than Moxon, had
undertaken to publish at their own risk, and which
appeared in 1849. Some care and thought were also
given by Browning to the alterations of text made in
the edition of his wife's Poems of the following year;
and for a time his own <i>Christmas Eve and Easter Day</i>
was an absorbing occupation. As to the "reading,"
the chief disadvantage of Florence towards the middle
of the last century was the difficulty of seeing new
books of interest, whether French or English. Yet
<i>Vanity Fair</i> and <i>The Princess, Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Modern
Painters</i> somehow found their way to Casa Guidi.<a name="FNanchor_44"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>
<p>Casa Guidi proper, the Casa Guidi which held the
<a name="Page_115"></a>books and pictures and furniture and graceful
knick-knacks
chosen by its occupants, who were lovers of
beauty, dates only from 1848. Previously they had
been satisfied with a furnished apartment. Not long
before the unfurnished rooms were hired, a mistake in
choosing rooms which suffered from the absence of
sunshine and warmth gave Browning an opportunity
of displaying what to his wife's eyes appeared to be
unexampled magnanimity. The six months' rent was
promptly paid, and chambers on the Pitti "yellow with
sunshine from morning to evening" were secured.
"Any other man, a little lower than the angels," his
wife assured Miss Mitford, "would have stamped and
sworn a little for the mere relief of the thing, but as to
<i>his</i> being angry with <i>me</i> for any cause, except not
eating enough dinner, the sun would turn the wrong
way first." It seemed an excellent piece of economy
to take the spacious suite of unfurnished rooms in the
Via Maggio, now distinguished by the inscription
known to all visitors to Florence, which were to be
had for twenty-five guineas a year, and which, when
furnished, might be let during any prolonged absence
for a considerable sum. The temptation of a ground-floor
in the Frescobaldi Palace, and a garden bright
with camellias, to which Browning for a time inclined,
was rejected. At Casa Guidi the double terrace where
orange-trees and camellias also might find a place
made amends for the garden with its threatening cloud
of mosquitoes, "worse than Austrians"; every need of
space and height, of warmth and coolness seemed to
be met; and it only remained to expend the welcome
proceeds of the sale of books in the recreation of
gathering together "rococo chairs, spring sofas, carved
<a name="Page_116"></a>bookcases, satin from cardinals' beds and the
rest."
Before long Browning amused himself in picking up
for a few pauls this or that picture, on seeing which an
accomplished connoisseur, like Kirkup, would even
hazard the name of Cimabue or Ghirlandaio, or if not
that of Giotto, then the safer adjective Giottesque.</p>
<p>Although living the life of retirement which his
wife's uncertain state of health required, Browning
gradually obtained the acquaintance of several interesting
persons, of whom Kirkup, who has just been
mentioned, was one. "As to Italian society," wrote
Mrs Browning, "one may as well take to longing for
the evening star, for it seems quite inaccessible." But
the name of Elizabeth Barrett, if not yet that of
Robert Browning, was a sufficient introduction to
cultivated Englishmen and Americans who had made
Florence their home. Among the earliest of these
acquaintances were the American sculptor Powers,
Swedenborgian and spiritualist (a simple and genial
man, "with eyes like a wild Indian's, so black and full
of light"), and Hillard, the American lawyer, who, in
his <i>Six months in Italy</i>, described Browning's conversation
as "like the poetry of Chaucer," meaning perhaps
that it was hearty, fresh, and vigorous, "or like his own
poetry simplified and made transparent." "It seems
impossible," Hillard goes on, "to think that he can
ever grow old." And of Mrs Browning: "I have
never seen a human frame which seemed so nearly a
transparent veil for a celestial and immortal spirit.
She is a soul of fire enclosed in a shell of pearl." A
third American friend was one who could bring tidings
of Emerson and Hawthorne&#8212;Margaret Fuller of
"The Dial," now Countess d'Ossoli, "far better than
<a name="Page_117"></a>her writings," says Mrs Browning, "... not only
exalted but <i>exalt&eacute;e</i> in her opinions, yet calm in
manner." Her loss, with that of her husband, on
their voyage to America deeply affected Mrs Browning.
"Was she happy in anything?" asks her sorrowing
friend. The first person seen on Italian soil when
Browning and his wife disembarked at Leghorn was
the brilliant and erratic Irish priest, "Father Prout" of
<i>Fraser's Magazine</i>, who befriended them with good
spirits and a potion of eggs and port wine when
Browning was ill in Florence, and chided Mrs Browning
as a "bambina" for her needless fears. Charles Lever
"with the sunniest of faces and cordialest of manners"&#8212;animal
spirits preponderating a little too much over
an energetic intellect&#8212;called on them at the Baths
of Lucca, but the acquaintance did not ripen into
friendship. And little Miss Boyle, one of the family of
the Earls of Cork, would come at night, at the hour of
chestnuts and mulled wine, to sparkle as vivaciously as
the pine-log that warmed her feet. These, with the
Hoppners, known to Shelley and Byron, a French
sculptress of royalist sympathies, Mlle. de Fauveau,
much admired by Browning, and one of the grandsons
of Goethe, who flits into and out of the scene, were a
compensation for the repulsiveness of certain English
folk at Florence who gathered together only for the
frivolities, and worse than frivolities, of foreign
wayfaring.</p>
<p>In March 1849 joy and sorrow met and mingled
in the lives of Browning and his wife. On the ninth
of that month a son was born at Casa Guidi, who six
weeks later was described by his mother as "a lovely,
fat, strong child, with double chin and rosy cheeks
<a name="Page_118"></a>and a great wide chest." He was baptised, with
the
simple Lutheran rites, Robert Wiedemann Barrett&#8212;the
"Wiedemann" in remembrance of the maiden name of
Browning's mother. From the first, Browning and his
wife, to adopt a phrase from one of her letters, caught
up their parental pleasures with a sort of passion.<a name="FNanchor_45"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> Mrs
Browning's letters croon with happiness in the beauty,
the strength, the intelligence, the kind-hearted disposition
of her boy. And the boy's father, from the days
when he would walk up and down the terrace of Casa
Guidi with the infant in his arms to the last days of
his life, felt to the full the gladness and the repose that
came with this strong bondage of his heart. When
little Wiedemann could frame imperfect speech upon
his lips he transformed that name into "Penini,"
which abbreviated to "Pen" became serviceable for
domesticities. It was a fantastic derivation of
Nathaniel Hawthorne which connected Penini with
the colossal statue in Florence bearing the name of
"Apeninno." Flush for a time grew jealous, and not
altogether without cause.</p>
<p>But the joy was pursued and overtaken by sorrow.
A few days after the birth of his son came tidings of
the death of Browning's mother. He had loved her
with a rare degree of passion; the sudden reaction
from the happiness of his wife's safety and his son's
birth was terrible; it almost seemed a wrong to his
grief to admit into his consciousness the new gladness
of the time. In this conflict of emotions his spirits
and to some extent his health gave way. He could
not think of returning to his father's home without
extreme pain&#8212;"It would break his heart," he said, "to
<a name="Page_119"></a>see his mother's roses over the wall, and the
place
where she used to lay her scissors and gloves." He
longed that his father and sister should quit the home
of sorrow, and hasten to Florence; but this was not
to be. As for England, it could not be thought of as
much on his wife's account as his own. Her father held
no communication with her; supplicating letters remained
unnoticed; her brothers were temporarily estranged.
Her sister Henrietta had left her former home; having
"insulted" her father by asking his consent to her
marriage with Captain Surtees Cook, she had taken
the matter into her own hands; the deed was done,
and the name of his second undutiful daughter&#8212;married
to a person of moderate means and odiously
"Tractarian views"&#8212;was never again to be mentioned
in Mr Barrett's presence. England had become for
Mrs Browning a place of painful memories, and a
centre of present strife which she did not feel herself
as yet able to encounter.</p>
<p>The love of wandering, however, when successive
summers came, and Florence was ablaze with sunshine,
grew irresistible, and drove Browning and his household
to seek elsewhere for fresh interests or for coolness
and repose. In 1848, beguiled by the guide-book,
they visited Fano to find it quivering with heat, "the
very air swooning in the sun." Their reward at Fano
was that picture by Guercino of the guardian angel
teaching a child to pray, the thought of which Browning
has translated into song:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>We were at Fano, and three times we went<br />
</span><span>To sit and see him in his chapel there,<br />
</span><span>And drink his beauty to our soul's content<br />
</span><span>&#8212;My angel with me too.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_120"></a>Ancona, where the poem was written, if its
last
line is historically true, followed Fano, among whose
brown rocks, "elbowing out the purple tides," and brown
houses&#8212;"an exfoliation of the rock"&#8212;they lived for a
week on fish and cold water. The tour included
Rimini and Ravenna, with a return to Florence by
Forli and a passage through the Apennines. Next
year&#8212;1849&#8212;when Pen was a few months old, the
drop of gipsy blood in Browning's veins, to which his
wife jestingly refers, tingled but faintly; it was Mrs
Browning's part to compel him, for the baby's sake and
hers, to seek his own good. They visited Spezzia and
glanced at the house of Shelley at Lerici; passed
through olive woods and vineyards, and rested in "a
sort of eagle's nest" at the highest habitable point of
the Baths of Lucca. Here the baby's great cheeks
grew rosier; Browning gained in spirits; and his wife
was able "to climb the hills and help him to lose
himself in the forests." When they wandered at noon
except for some bare-footed peasant or some monk
with the rope around his waist, it was complete solitude;
and on moonlit nights they sat by the waterfalls in
an atmosphere that had the lightness of mountain air
without its keenness. On one occasion they climbed
by dry torrent courses five miles into the mountains,
baby and all, on horseback and donkeyback&#8212;"such
a congregation of mountains; looking alive in the
stormy light we saw them by." It was certainly a
blessed transformation of the prostrate invalid in the
upper room at Wimpole Street. Setting aside his own
happiness, Browning could feel with regard to her and
his deep desire to serve her, that he had seen of the
travail of his soul, and in this matter was satisfied.</p>
<p><a name="Page_121"></a>The weeks at Siena of the year 1850 were not
quite so prosperous. During that summer Mrs
Browning had been seriously ill. When sufficiently
recovered she was carried by her husband to a villa
in the midst of vines and olives, a mile and a half or
two miles outside Siena, which commanded a noble
prospect of hills and plain. At first she could only
remain seated in the easy-chair which he found for her
in the city. For a day there was much alarm on behalf
of the boy, now able to run about, who lay with
heavy head and glassy eyes in a half-stupor; but
presently he was astir again, and his "singing voice"
was heard in the house and garden. Mrs Browning
in the fresh yet warm September air regained her
strength. Before returning to Florence, they spent a
week in the city to see the churches and the pictures
by Sodoma. Even little Wiedemann screamed for
church-interiors and developed remarkable imitative
pietisms of a theatrical kind. "It was as well," said
Browning, "to have the eyeteeth and the Puseyistical
crisis over together."</p>
<p>This comment, although no more than a passing
word spoken in play, gives a correct indication of
Browning's feeling, fully shared in by his wife, towards
the religious movement in England which was altering
the face of the established Church. "Puseyism" was
for them a kind of child's play which unfortunately
had religion for its play-ground; they viewed it with
a superior smile, in which there was more of pity than
of anger. Both of them, though one was a writer
for the stage and the other could read <i>Madame
Bovary</i> without flinching and approved the morals of
<i>La Dame aux Cam&eacute;lias</i>, had their roots in English
<a name="Page_122"></a>Puritanism.<a name="FNanchor_46"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> And now the time had come when
Browning was to embody some of his Puritan
thoughts and feelings relating to religion in a highly
original poem.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_123"></a>Chapter VII</h2>
<h2>Christmas Eve and Easter Day</h2>
<br />
<p><i>Christmas Eve and Easter Day</i> was published by
Chapman &amp; Hall in the year 1850. It was reported
to the author that within the first fortnight two
hundred copies had been sold, with which evidence
of moderate popularity he was pleased; but the initial
success was not maintained and subsequently the book
became, like <i>Sordello</i>, a "remainder." As early as
1845, in the opening days of the correspondence with
Miss Barrett, when she had called upon her friend to
speak as poet in his own person and to speak out, he
assured her that whereas hitherto he had only made
men and women utter themselves on his behalf and
had given the truth not as pure white light but
broken into prismatic hues, now he would try to
declare directly that which was in him. In place of
his men and women he would have her to be a companion
in his work, and yet, he adds, "I don't think
I shall let <i>you</i> hear, after all, the savage things about
Popes and imaginative religions that I must say."
We can only conjecture as to whether the theme of
the poem of 1850 was already in Browning's mind.
His wife's influence certainly was not unlikely to incline
him towards the choice of a subject which had
some immediate relation to contemporary thought.
She knew that poetry to be of permanent value
<a name="Page_124"></a>must do more than reflect a passing fashion;
that
in a certain sense it must in its essence be out of
time and space, expressing ideas and passions which
are parts of our abiding humanity. Yet she recognised
an advantage in pressing into what is permanent
through the forms which it assumes in the world immediately
around the artist. And even in 1845 the
design of such a poem as her own <i>Aurora Leigh</i> was
occupying her thoughts; she speaks of her intention
of writing a sort of "novel-poem, running into the
midst of our conventions, and rushing into drawing-rooms
and the like, 'where angels fear to tread';
and so, meeting face to face and without mask the
Humanity of the age, and speaking the truth as I
conceive of it out plainly." Browning's poem did not
rush into drawing-rooms, but it stepped boldly into
churches and conventicles and the lecture-rooms of
theological professors.</p>
<p>The spiritual life individual and the spiritual life
corporate&#8212;these, to state it in a word, are the subjects
dealt with in the two connected poems of his
new volume; the spiritual life individual is considered
in <i>Easter Day</i>; the spiritual life corporate in <i>Christmas
Eve.</i> Browning, with the blood of all the Puritans in
him, as his wife expressed it, could not undervalue
that strain of piety which had descended from the
exiles at Geneva and had run on through the struggles
for religious liberty in the nonconformist religious
societies of the seventeenth century and the Evangelical
revival of times less remote. Looking around
him he had seen in his own day the progress of two
remarkable movements&#8212;one embodying, or professing
to embody, the Catholic as opposed to the Puritan
<a name="Page_125"></a>conception of religion, the other a free
critical movement,
tending to the disintegration of the traditional
dogma of Christianity, yet seeking to preserve and
maintain its ethical and even in part its religious influence.
The facts can be put concisely if we say
that one and the same epoch produced in England the
sermons of Spurgeon, the <i>Apologia pro vita sua</i> of
Newman, and the <i>Literature and Dogma</i> of Matthew
Arnold. To discuss these three conceptions of religion
adequately in verse would have been impossible even
for the argumentative genius of Dryden, and would
have converted a work of art into a theological treatise.
But three representative scenes might be painted, and
some truths of passionate feeling might be flung out
by way of commentary. Such was the design of the
poet of <i>Christmas Eve</i>.</p>
<p>To topple over from the sublime to the ridiculous
is not difficult. But the presence of humour might
save the sublimities from a fall, and Browning had
hitherto in his art made but slight and occasional use
of a considerable gift of humour which he possessed.
It was humour not of the highest or finest or subtlest
kind; it was very far from the humour of Shakespeare
or of Cervantes, which felt so profoundly all
the incongruities, majestic, pathetic, and laughable, of
human nature. But it had a rough vigour of its own;
it was united with a capacity for exact and shrewd
observation; and if it should ever lead him to play
the part of a satirist, the satire must needs be rather
that of love than of malice. One who esteemed so
highly the work of Balzac and of Flaubert might
well be surmised to have something in his composition
of what we now call the realist in art; and the work
<a name="Page_126"></a>of the realist might serve to sustain and
vindicate the
idealist's ventures of imaginative faith. The picture
of the lath-and-plaster entry of "Mount Zion" and of
the pious sheep&#8212;duly indignant at the interloper in
their midst&#8212;who one by one enter the fold, if not
worthy of Cervantes or of Shakespeare, is hardly
inferior to the descriptive passages of Dickens, and it
is touched, in the manner of Dickens, with pity for
these rags and tatters of humanity. The night, the
black barricade of cloud, the sudden apparition of the
moon, the vast double rainbow, and He whose sweepy
garment eddies onward, become at once more supernatural
and more unquestionably real because sublimity
springs out of grotesquerie. Is the vision of the face
of Christ an illusion?</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The whole face turned upon me full,<br />
</span><span>And I spread myself beneath it,<br />
</span><span>As when the bleacher spreads, to seethe it<br />
</span><span>In the cleansing sun, his wool,&#8212;<br />
</span><span>Steeps in the flood of noontide whiteness<br />
</span><span>Some defiled, discoloured web&#8212;<br />
</span><span>So lay I saturate, with brightness.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Is this a phantom or a dream? Well, at least it
is certain that the witness has seen with his mortal
eyes the fat weary woman, and heard the mighty
report of her umbrella, "wry and flapping, a wreck of
whalebones." And the fat woman of Mount Zion
Chapel, with Love Lane at the back of it, may help
us to credit the awful vision of the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus the poem has the imaginative sensuousness
which art demands; it is not an argument but a series
of vivid experiences, though what is sensuous is here
tasked in the service of what is spiritual, and a com<a name="Page_127"></a>mentary
is added. The central idea of the whole is
that where love is, there is Christ; and the Christ of
this poem is certainly no abstraction, no moral ideal,
no transcendental conception of absolute charity, but
very God and very man, the Christ of Nazareth, who
dwelt among men, full of grace and truth. Literary
criticism which would interpret Browning's meaning in
any other sense may be ingenious, but it is not disinterested,
and some side-wind blows it far from the
mark.</p>
<p>Love with defective knowledge, he maintains, is of
more spiritual worth than knowledge with defective
love. Desiring to give salience to this idea, he deprives
his little pious conventicle of every virtue except
one&#8212;"love," and no other word is written on each
forehead of the worshippers. Browning, the artist and
student of art, was not insensible to the spiritual power
of beauty; and beauty is conspicuously absent from
the praise and prayer that went up from Mount Zion
chapel; its forms of worship are burlesque and uncouth.
Browning, the lover of knowledge, was not insensible
to the value of intelligence in things of religion; and
the congregation of Mount Zion sit on "divinely
flustered" under</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>the pig-of-lead-like pressure<br />
</span><span>Of the preaching man's immense stupidity.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The pastor, whose words so sway his enraptured flock,
mangles the Holy Scriptures with a fine irreverence,
and pours forth his doctrine with an entirely self-satisfied
indifference to reason and common sense.
Nor has love accomplished its perfect work, for the
interloper who stands at the entry is eyed with inquisitorial
glances of pious exclusiveness&#8212;how has a
<a name="Page_128"></a>Gallio such as he ventured to take his station
among
the elect? Matthew Arnold, had he visited Mount
Zion, might have discoursed with a charmingly insolent
urbanity on the genius for ugliness in English dissent,
and the supreme need of bringing a current of new
ideas to play upon the unintelligent use of its
traditional formulae. And Matthew Arnold would
have been right. These are the precise subjects of
Browning's somewhat rough-and-ready satire. But
Browning adds that in Mount Zion, love, at least in
its rudiments, is present, and where love is, there is
Christ.</p>
<p>Of English nonconformity in its humblest forms
Browning can write, as it were, from within; he writes
of Roman Catholic forms of worship as one who stands
outside; his sympathy with the prostrate multitude
in St. Peter's at Rome is of an impersonal kind,
founded rather upon the recognition of an objective
fact than springing from an instinctive feeling. For
a moment he is carried away by the tide of their
devout enthusiasms; but he recovers himself to find
indeed that love is also here and therefore Christ is
present, but the worshippers fallen under "Rome's
gross yoke," are very infants in their need of these
sacred buffooneries and posturings and petticoatings;
infants</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Peevish as ever to be suckled,<br />
</span><span>Lulled with the same old baby-prattle<br />
</span><span>With intermixture of the rattle.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>And this, though the time has come when love would
have them no longer infantile, but capable of standing
and walking, "not to speak of trying to climb." Such
a short and easy method of dealing with Roman
<a name="Page_129"></a>Catholic dogma and ritual cannot be commended
for
its intelligence; it is quite possible to be on the same
side as Browning without being as crude as he in
misconception. He does not seriously consider the
Catholic idea which regards things of sense as made
luminous by the spirit of which they are the envoys and
the ministers. It is enough for him to declare his own
creed which treats any intermediary between the human
soul and the Divine as an obstruction or a veil:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>My heart does best to receive in meekness<br />
</span><span>That mode of worship, as most to his mind,<br />
</span><span>Where earthly aids being left behind,<br />
</span><span>His All in All appears serene<br />
</span><span>With the thinnest human veil between,<br />
</span><span>Letting the mystic lamps, the seven,<br />
</span><span>The many motions of his spirit,<br />
</span><span>Pass as they list to earth from heaven.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>This was the creed of Milton and of Bunyan; and
yet with both Milton and Bunyan the imagery of
the senses is employed as the means not of concealing
but revealing the things of the spirit.</p>
<p>From the lecture-room of G&ouml;ttingen, with its destructive
and reconstructive criticism, Browning is even
farther removed than he is from the ritualisms of the
Roman basilica. Yet no caricature can be more
amiable than his drawing of the learned Professor,
so gentle in his aspect, so formidable in his conclusions,
who, gazing into the air with a pure abstracted look,
proceeds in a grave sweet voice to exhibit and analyse
the sources of the myth of Christ. In the Professor's
lecture-room Browning finds intellect indeed but only
the shadow of love. He argues that if the "myth"
of Christ be dissolved, the authority of Christ as a
<a name="Page_130"></a>teacher disappears; Christ is even inferior to
other
moralists by virtue of the fact that He made personal
claims which cannot be sustained. And whatever
may be Christ's merit as a teacher of the truth, the
motive to action which His life and words supplied
must cease to exist if it be shown that the divine
sacrifice of God manifest in the flesh is no more than
a figment of the devout imagination. At every point
the criticism of Browning is as far apart as it is
possible to conceive from the criticism set forth in
the later writings of Matthew Arnold. The one
writer regards the "myth" as no more than the grave-clothes
of a risen Christ whose essential virtue lies in
his sweet reasonableness and his morality touched with
enthusiasm. The other believes that if the wonderful
story of love be proved a fable, a profound alteration&#8212;and
an alteration for the worse&#8212;has been made in
the religious consciousness of Christendom. And
undoubtedly the difference between the supernatural
and the natural theories of Christianity is far greater
than Arnold represented it to be. But Browning at
this date very inadequately conceived the power of
Christ as a revealer of the fatherhood of God. In that
revelation, whether the Son of God was human or
divine, lay a truth of surpassing power, and a motive
of action capable of summoning forth the purest and
highest energies of the soul. That such is the case
has been abundantly evidenced by the facts of history.
Browning finds only much learning and the ghost of
dead love in the G&ouml;ttingen lecture-room; and of
course it was easy to adapt his Professor's lecture
so as to arrive at this conclusion. But the process
and the conclusion are alike unjust.</p>
<p><a name="Page_131"></a>Having traversed the various forms of
Christian
faith and scepticism, the speaker in <i>Christmas Eve</i>
declines into a mood of lazy benevolence and mild
indifferentism towards each and all of these. Has
not Christ been present alike at the holding-forth of
the poor dissenting son of thunder, who tore God's
word into shreds, at the tinklings and posturings and
incense-fumes of Roman pietism, and even at the
learned discourse which dissolved the myth of his
own life and death? Why, then, over-strenuously take
a side? Why not regard all phases of belief or no-belief
with equal and serene regard? Such a mood
of amiable indifferentism is abhorrent to Browning's
feelings. The hem of Christ's robe passes wholly at
this point from the hand of the seer of visions in his
poem. One best way of worship there needs must be;
ours may indeed not be the absolutely best, but it
is our part, it is our probation to see that we strive
earnestly after what is best; yes, and strive with
might and main to confer upon our fellows the gains
which we have found. It may be God's part&#8212;we
trust it is&#8212;to bring all wanderers to the one fold at
last. As for us, we must seek after Him and find Him
in the mode required by our highest thought, our
purest passion. Here Browning speaks from his
central feeling. Only, we may ask, what if one's
truest self lie somewhere hidden amid a thousand
hesitating sympathies? And is not the world
spacious enough to include a Montaigne as well
as a Pascal or a Browning? Assuredly the world
without its Montaigne would be a poorer and a
less hospitable dwelling-place for the spirits of
men.</p>
<p><a name="Page_132"></a>Mrs Browning complained to her husband of
what
she terms the asceticism of <i>Easter Day</i>, the second
part of his volume of 1850; his reply was that it
stated "one side of the question." "Don't think,"
Mrs Browning says, "that he has taken to the cilix&#8212;indeed
he has not&#8212;but it is his way to <i>see</i> things as
passionately as other people <i>feel</i> them." <i>Easter Day</i>
has nothing to say of religious life in Churches and
societies, nothing of the communities of public worship.
For the writer of this poem only three things
exist&#8212;God, the individual soul, and the world regarded
as the testing place and training place of the soul.
Browning has here a rigour of moral or spiritual
earnestness which may be called, by any one who so
pleases, Puritan in its kind and its intensity; he feels
the need, if we are to attain any approximation to the
Christian ideal, of the lit lamp and the girt loin. Two
difficulties in the Christian life in particular he chooses
to consider&#8212;first, the difficulty of faith in the things
of the spirit, and especially in what he regards as the
essential parts of the Christian story; and secondly,
the difficulty of obeying the injunction to renounce the
world. That we cannot grow to our highest attainment
by the old method enjoined by pagan philosophy&#8212;that
of living according to nature, he regards as
evident, for nature itself is warped and marred; it
groans and travails, and from its discords how shall
we frame a harmony? It was always his habit of
mind, he tells us, from his childhood onwards, to face
a danger and confront a doubt, and if there were anywhere
a lurking fear, to draw this forth from its hiding-place
and examine it in the light, even at the risk of
some mortal ill. Therefore he will press for an answer
<a name="Page_133"></a>to his present questionings; he will try
conclusions
to the uttermost.</p>
<p>As to the initial difficulty of faith, Browning with
a touch of scorn, assures us that evidences of spiritual
realities, evidences of Christianity&#8212;as they are styled&#8212;external
and internal will be readily found by him
who desires to find; convincing enough they are for
him who wants to be convinced. But in truth faith is
a noble venture of the spirit, an aspiring effort towards
what is best, even though what is best may never be
attained. The mole gropes blindly in unquestionably
solid clay; better be like the grasshopper "that spends
itself in leaps all day to reach the sun." A grasshopper's
leap sunwards&#8212;that is what we signify by
this word "faith."</p>
<p>But the difficulties of the Christian life only shift
their place when faith by whatever means has been
won. We are bidden to renounce the world: what
does the injunction mean? in what way shall it be
obeyed? "Ascetic" Mrs Browning named this poem;
and ascetic it is if by that word we understand the
counselling and exhorting to a noble exercise and
discipline; but Browning even in his poem by no
means wears the cilix, and no teaching can be more
fatal than his to asceticism in the narrower sense of
the word. To renounce the world, if interpreted aright,
is to extinguish or suppress no faculty that has been
given to man, but rather to put each faculty to its highest
uses:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"Renounce the world!"&#8212;Ah, were it done<br />
</span><span>By merely cutting one by one<br />
</span><span>Your limbs off, with your wise head last,<br />
</span><span>How easy were it!&#8212;how soon past,<br />
</span><span>If once in the believing mood.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_134"></a>The harder and the higher renunciation is
this&#8212;to
choose the things of the spirit rather than the things
of sense, and again in accepting, as means of our
earthly discipline and development, the things of sense
to press through these to the things of the spirit which
lie behind and beyond and above them.</p>
<p>Such, and such alone, is the asceticism to which
Browning summons his disciple; it is the asceticism
of energy not that of atrophy; it does not starve the
senses, but reinforces the spirit; it results not in a
cloistered but a militant virtue. A certain self-denial
it may demand, but the self-denial becomes the condition
of a higher joy. And if life with its trials
frays the flesh, what matters it when the light of the
spirit shines through with only a fuller potency? In
the choice between sense and spirit, or, to put it more
generally, in the choice between what is higher and
less high, lies the probation of a soul, and also its
means of growth. And what is the meaning of this
mortal life&#8212;this strange phenomenon otherwise so
unintelligible&#8212;if it be not the moment in which a
soul is proved, the period in which a soul is shaped
and developed for other lives to come?</p>
<p>To forget that Browning is a preacher may suit a
dainty kind of criticism which detaches the idea of
beauty from the total of our humanity addressed by
the greater artists. But the solemn thoughts that are
taken up by beauty in such work, for example, as that
of Michael Angelo, are an essential element or an
essential condition of its peculiar character as a thing
of beauty. And armour, we know, may be as lovely
to the mere senses as a flower. Browning's doctrine
may sometimes protrude gauntly through his poetry;
<a name="Page_135"></a>but at his best&#8212;as in <i>Rabbi ben Ezra</i> or <i>Abt
Vogler</i>&#8212;the
thought of the poem is needful in the dance of
lyrical enthusiasm, as the male partner who takes
hands with beauty, and to separate them would bring
the dance to a sudden close. Both are present in
<i>Easter Day</i>, and we must watch the movement of the
two. In a passage already quoted from <i>Christmas
Eve</i> the face of Christ is nobly imagined as the sun
which bleaches a discoloured web. Here the poet's
imagination is as intense in its presentation of Christ
the doomsman:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>He stood there. Like the smoke<br />
</span><span>Pillared o'er Sodom, when day broke&#8212;<br />
</span><span>I saw Him. One magnific pall<br />
</span><span>Mantled in massive fold and fall<br />
</span><span>His head, and coiled in snaky swathes<br />
</span><span>About His feet; night's black, that bathes<br />
</span><span>All else, broke, grizzled with despair,<br />
</span><span>Against the soul of blackness there.<br />
</span><span>A gesture told the mood within&#8212;<br />
</span><span>That wrapped right hand which based the chin,&#8212;<br />
</span><span>That intense meditation fixed<br />
</span><span>On His procedure,&#8212;pity mixed<br />
</span><span>With the fulfilment of decree.<br />
</span><span>Motionless thus, He spoke to me,<br />
</span><span>Who fell before His feet, a mass,<br />
</span><span>No man now.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The picture of the final conflagration of the Judgment
Day is perhaps over-laboured, a descriptive <i>tour de
force</i>, horror piled upon horror with accumulative power,&#8212;a
picture somewhat too much in the manner of Martin;
and the verse does not lend itself to the sustained sublimity
of terror. The glow of Milton's hell is intenser,
and Milton's majestic instrumentation alone could
render the voices of its flames. The real awfulness
<a name="Page_136"></a>of Browning's Judgment Day dwells wholly in the
inner experiences of a solitary soul. The speaker
finds of a sudden that the doom is upon him, and
that in the probation of life his choice was earth, not
heaven. The sentence pronounced upon him is in
accordance with the election of his own will&#8212;let earth,
with all its beauty of nature, all its gifts of human
art, all its successes of the intellect, as he had conceived
and chosen them, be his. To his despair,
he finds that what he had prized in life, and what
is now granted to him cannot bring him happiness
or even content. The plenitude of beauty, of which
all partial beauty was but a pledge, is forever lost to
him. The glory of art, which lay beyond its poor actual
attainments, is lost. The joy of knowledge, with all those</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>grasps of guess<br />
</span><span>Which pull the more into the less,<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>is lost. And as to earth's best possession&#8212;love&#8212;had
he ever made a discovery through human love
of that which it forthshadows&#8212;the love that is perfect
and divine? Earth is no longer earth to the doomed
man, but the star of the god Rephan of which we
read in one of Browning's latest poems; in the horror
of its blank and passionless uniformity, untroubled by
any spiritual presences, he cowers at the Judge's feet,
and prays for darkness, hunger, toil, distress, if only
hope be also granted him:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Then did the form expand, expand&#8212;<br />
</span><span>knew Him through the dread disguise<br />
</span><span>As the whole God within his eyes<br />
</span><span>Embraced me.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The Doomsman has in a moment become the
Saviour. In all this, if Browning has the burden
<a name="Page_137"></a>of a prophecy to utter, he utters it, after the
manner
of earlier prophets, as a vision. His art is sensuous
and passionate; his argument is transformed into a
series of imaginative experiences.</p>
<p>Mrs. Browning's illness during the summer and
early autumn of 1850 left her for a time more shaken
in health than she had been since her marriage. But
by the spring of the following year she had recovered
strength; and designs of travel were formed, which
should include Rome, North Italy, Switzerland, the
Rhine, Brussels, Paris and London. Almost at the
moment of starting for Rome at the end of April, the
plans were altered; the season was too far advanced
for going south; ways and means must be economised;
Rome might be postponed for a future visit; and
Venice would make amends for the present sacrifice.
And Venice in May and early June did indeed for a
time make amends. "I have been between heaven
and earth," Mrs. Browning wrote, "since our arrival
at Venice." The rich architecture, the colour, the
moonlight, the music, the enchanting silence made
up a unity of pleasures like nothing that she had
previously known. When evening came she and her
husband would follow the opera from their box
hired for "two shillings and eightpence English,"
or sit under the moon in the piazza of St Mark
sipping coffee and reading the French papers.
But as the month went by, Browning lost appetite
and lost sleep. The "soothing, lulling, rocking
atmosphere" which suited Mrs. Browning made
him, after the first excitement of delight, grow
nervous and dispirited. They hastened away to
Padua, drove to Arqua, "for Petrarch's sake," passed
<a name="Page_138"></a>through Brescia in a flood of white moonlight,
and
having reached Milan climbed&#8212;the invalid of Wimpole
Street and her husband&#8212;to the topmost point
of the cathedral. From the Italian lakes they crossed
by the St Gothard to Switzerland, and omitting part
of their original scheme of wandering, journeyed in
twenty-four hours without stopping from Strasburg to
Paris.</p>
<p>In Paris they loitered for three weeks. Mrs.
Browning during the short visit which followed her
marriage had hardly seen the city. Bright shop-windows,
before which little Wiedemann would scream
with pleasure, restaurants and dinners <i>&agrave; la carte</i>,
full-foliaged
trees and gardens in the heart of the town
were a not unwelcome exchange for Italian church-interiors
and altar-pieces. Even "disreputable prints
and fascinating hats and caps" were appreciated as
proper to the genius of the place, and the writer of
<i>Casa Guidi Windows</i> had the happiness of seeing her
hero, M. le President, "in a cocked hat, and with a
train of cavalry, passing like a rocket along the
boulevards to an occasional yell from the Red." By
a happy chance they lighted in Paris upon Tennyson,
now Poet-laureate, whom Mrs. Browning had hitherto
known only through his poems; he was in the
friendliest mood, and urged that they should make
use of his house and servants during their stay in
England, an offer which was not refused, though there
was no intention of actually taking advantage of the
kindness. As for England, the thought of it, with
her father's heart and her father's door closed against
her, was bitter as wormwood to Mrs. Browning. "It's only
Robert," she wrote, "who is a patriot now, of us two."</p>
<p><a name="Page_139"></a>English soil as they stepped ashore was a
puddle, and
English air a fog. London lodgings were taken at 26
Devonshire Street, and, although Mrs. Browning suffered
from the climate, they were soon dizzied and dazzled
by the whirl of pleasant hospitalities. An evening with
Carlyle ("one of the greatest sights in England"), a
dinner given by Forster at Thames Ditton, "in sight
of the swans," a breakfast with Rogers, daily visits
of Barry Cornwall, cordial companionship of Mrs.
Jameson, a performance by the Literary Guild actors,
a reading of <i>Hamlet</i> by Fanny Kemble&#8212;with these
distractions and such as these the two months flew
quickly. It was in some ways a relief when Pen's
faithful maid Wilson went for a fortnight to see her
kinsfolk, and Mrs. Browning had to take her place
and substitute for social racketing domestic cares.
The one central sorrow remained and in some respects
was intensified. She had written to her father, and
Browning himself wrote&#8212;"a manly, true, straight-forward
letter," she informs a friend, "... everywhere
generous and conciliating." A violent and unsparing
reply was made, and with it came all the letters that
his undutiful daughter had written to Mr. Barrett; not
one had been read or opened. He returned them
now, because he had not previously known how he could
be relieved of the obnoxious documents. "God takes
it all into his own hands," wrote Mrs. Browning, "and
I wait." Something, however, was gained; her brothers
were reconciled; Arabella Barrett was constant in
kindness; and Henrietta journeyed from Taunton
to London to enjoy a week in her company.</p>
<p>It was at Devonshire Street that Bayard Taylor,
the distinguished American poet and critic, made the
<a name="Page_140"></a>acquaintance of the Brownings, and the record of
his
visit gives a picture of Browning at the age of thirty-nine,
so clearly and firmly drawn that it ought not
to be omitted here: "In a small drawing-room on
the first floor I met Browning, who received me with
great cordiality. In his lively, cheerful manner,
quick voice, and perfect self-possession, he made the
impression of an American rather than an Englishman.
He was then, I should judge, about thirty-seven years
of age, but his dark hair was already streaked with
gray about the temples. His complexion was fair,
with perhaps the faintest olive tinge, eyes large, clear,
and gray, nose strong and well cut, mouth full and
rather broad, and chin pointed, though not prominent.
His forehead broadened rapidly upwards from the outer
angle of the eyes, slightly retreating. The strong
individuality which marks his poetry was expressed
not only in his face and head, but in his whole demeanour.
He was about the medium height, strong
in the shoulders, but slender at the waist, and his
movements expressed a combination of vigour and
elasticity." Mrs Browning with her slight figure,
pale face, shaded by chestnut curls, and grave eyes of
bluish gray, is also described; and presently entered to
the American visitor Pen, a blue-eyed, golden-haired
boy, who babbled his little sentences in Italian.</p>
<p>When, towards the close of September, Browning
and his wife left London for Paris, Carlyle by his own
request was their companion on the journey. Mrs
Browning feared that his irritable nerves would suffer
from the vivacities of little Pen, but it was not so; he
accepted with good humour the fact that the small
boy had not yet learned, like his own Teufelsdr&ouml;ckh,
<a name="Page_141"></a>the Eternal No: "Why, sir," exclaimed Carlyle,
"you
have as many aspirations as Napoleon!"<a name="FNanchor_47"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> At Dieppe,
Browning, as Carlyle records, "did everything, fought
for us, and we&#8212;that is, the woman, the child and I&#8212;had
only to wait and be silent." At Paris in the midst
of "a crowding, jangling, vociferous tumult, the brave
Browning fought for us, leaving me to sit beside the
woman." An apartment was found on the sunny side
of the Avenue des Champs-Elys&eacute;es, "pretty, cheerful,
carpeted rooms," far brighter and better than those of
Devonshire Street, and when, to Browning's amusement,
his wife had moved every chair and table
into the new and absolutely right position, they could
rest and be thankful. Carlyle spent several evenings
with them, and repaid the assistance which he received
in various difficulties from Browning's command of the
language, by picturesque conversations in his native
speech: "You come to understand perfectly," wrote
Mrs Browning, "when you know him, that his bitterness
is only melancholy, and his scorn sensibility." A
little later Browning's father and sister spent some
weeks in Paris. Here, at all events, were perfect
relations between the members of a family group; the
daughter here was her father's comrade with something
even of a maternal instinct; and the grandfather
discovered to his great satisfaction that his own talent
for drawing had descended to his grandchild.</p>
<p>The time was one when the surface of life in Paris
showed an unruffled aspect; but under the surface
were heavings of inward agitation. On the morning
of December 2nd the great stroke against the Republic
was delivered; the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> was an accomplished
<a name="Page_142"></a>fact. Later in the day Louis Napoleon rode under
the
windows of the apartment in the Avenue des Champs-Elys&eacute;es,
from the Carrousel to the Arc de l'&Eacute;toile.
To Mrs Browning it seemed the grandest of spectacles&#8212;"he
rode there in the name of the people after all."
She and her husband had witnessed revolutions in
Florence, and political upheavals did not seem so very
formidable. On the Thursday of bloodshed in the
streets&#8212;December 4th&#8212;Pen was taken out for his
usual walk, though not without certain precautions; as
the day advanced the excitement grew tense, and when
night fell the distant firing on the boulevards kept Mrs.
Browning from her bed till one o'clock. On Saturday
they took a carriage and drove to see the field of
action; the crowds moved to and fro, discussing the
situation, but of real disturbance there was none; next
day the theatres had their customary spectators and
the Champs-Elys&eacute;es its promenaders. For the dishonoured
"Libert&eacute;, Egalit&eacute;, Fraternit&eacute;," as Mrs.
Browning heard it suggested, might now be inscribed
"Infanterie, Cavallerie, Artillerie."</p>
<p>Such may have been her husband's opinion, but such
was not hers. Her faith in the President had been
now and again shaken; her faith in the Emperor
became as time went on an enthusiasm of hero-worship.
The display of force on December 2nd impressed her
imagination; there was a dramatic completeness in
the whole performance; Napoleon represented the
people; a democrat, she thought, should be logical and
thorough; the vote of the millions entirely justified
their chief. Browning viewed affairs more critically,
more sceptically. "Robert and I," writes his wife
jestingly, "have had some domestic <i>&eacute;meutes</i>, because
<a name="Page_143"></a>he hates some imperial names." He detested all
Buonapartes, he would say, past, present, and to come,&#8212;an
outbreak explained by Mrs Browning to her
satisfaction, as being only his self-willed way of
dismissing a subject with which he refused to occupy
his thoughts, a mere escapade of feeling and known to
him as such. When all the logic and good sense were
on the woman's side, how could she be disturbed by
such masculine infirmities? Though only a very
little lower than the angels, he was after all that
humorous being&#8212;a man.</p>

<p>It was during the month of the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> that
Browning went back in thought to the poet of his
youthful love, and wrote that essay which was prefixed
to the volume of forged letters published as Shelley's
by Moxon in 1852. The essay is interesting as
Browning's only considerable piece of prose, and also
as an utterance made not through the mask of any
<i>dramatis persona</i>, but openly and directly from his own
lips. Though not without value as a contribution to
the study of Shelley's genius, it is perhaps chiefly of
importance as an exposition of some of Browning's
own views concerning his art. He distinguishes
between two kinds or types of poet: the poet who
like Shakespeare is primarily the "fashioner" of things
independent of his own personality, artistic creations
which embody some fact or reality, leaving it to others
to interpret, as best they are able, its significance; and
secondly the poet who is rather a "seer" than a
fashioner, who attempts to exhibit in imaginative form
his own conceptions of absolute truth, conceptions far
from entire adequacy, yet struggling towards completeness;
the poet who would shadow forth, as he himself
apprehends them, <i>Ideas</i>, to use the word of Plato,
"seeds of creation lying burningly on the Divine
Hand"&#8212;which Ideas he discovers not so often in the
<a name="Page_145"></a>external world as in his own soul, this being
for him
"the nearest reflex of the absolute Mind." What a
poet of this second kind produces, as Browning finely
states it, will be less a work than an effluence. He is
attracted among external phenomena chiefly by those
which summon forth his inner light and power, "he
selects that silence of the earth and sea in which he
can best hear the beating of his individual heart, and
leaves the noisy, complex, yet imperfect exhibitions of
nature in the manifold experience of man around him,
which serve only to distract and suppress the working
of his brain." To this latter class of poets, although
in <i>The Cenci</i> and <i>Julian and Maddalo</i> he is eminent as
a "fashioner," Shelley conspicuously belongs. Mankind
cannot wisely dispense with the services of either
type of poet; at one time it chiefly needs to have that
which is already known interpreted into its highest
meanings; and at another, when the virtue of these interpretations
has been appropriated and exhausted, it
needs a fresh study and exploration of the facts of life
and nature&#8212;for "the world is not to be learned and
thrown aside, but reverted to and relearned." The
truest and highest point of view from which to regard
the poetry of Shelley is that which shows it as a
"sublime fragmentary essay towards a presentment of
the correspondency of the universe to Deity, of the
natural to the spiritual, and of the actual to the
ideal."</p>
<p>For Browning the poet of <i>Prometheus Unbound</i> was
not that beautiful and ineffectual angel of Matthew
Arnold's fancy, beating in the void his luminous wings.
A great moral purpose looked forth from Shelley's
work, as it does, Browning would add, from all lofty
<a name="Page_146"></a>works of art. And it may be remarked that the
criticism of Browning's own writings which considers
not only their artistic methods and artistic success or
failure, but also their ethical and spiritual purport, is
entirely in accord with his thoughts in this essay.
Far from regarding Shelley as unpractical, he notes&#8212;and
with perfect justice&#8212;"the peculiar practicalness"
of Shelley's mind, which in his earlier years acted
injuriously upon both his conduct and his art. His
power to perceive the defects of society was accompanied
by as precocious a fertility to contrive remedies;
but his crudeness in theorising and his inexperience
in practice resulted in not a few youthful errors.
Gradually he left behind him "this low practical
dexterity"; gradually he learnt that "the best way
of removing abuses is to stand fast by truth. Truth
is one, as they are manifold; and innumerable negative
effects are produced by the upholding of one positive
principle." Browning urges that Shelley, before the
close, had passed from his doctrinaire atheism to what
was virtually a theistic faith. "I shall say what I
think," he adds&#8212;"had Shelley lived he would have
finally ranged himself with the Christians.... The
preliminary step to following Christ is the leaving the
dead to bury their dead." Perhaps this hypothetical
anticipation is to be classed with the surmise of
Cardinal Wiseman (if Father Prout rightly attributed
to that eminent ecclesiastic a review of <i>Men and
Women</i> in <i>The Rambler</i>) that Browning himself would
one day be found in the ranks of converts to Catholicism.
In each case a wish was father to the thought;
Browning recognised the fact that Shelley assigned a
place to love, side by side with power, among the
<a name="Page_147"></a>forces which determine the life and development
of
humanity, and with Browning himself "power" was a
synonym for the Divine will, and "love" was often an
equivalent for God manifest in Jesus Christ. One or
two other passages of the essay may be noted as
illustrating certain characteristics of the writer's modes
of thought and feeling: "Everywhere is apparent
Shelley's belief in the existence of Good, to which
Evil is an accident"&#8212;it is an optimist here, though
of a subtler doctrine than Shelley's, who is applauding
optimism. "Shelley was tender, though tenderness is
not always the characteristic of very sincere natures;
he was eminently both tender and sincere." Was
Browning consulting his own heart, which was always
sincere, and could be tender, but whose tenderness
sometimes disappeared in explosions of indignant
wrath? The principle, again, by which he determined
an artist's rank is in harmony with Browning's general
feeling that men are to be judged less by their actual
achievements than by the possibilities that lie unfolded
within them, and the ends to which they aspire, even
though such ends be unattained: "In the hierarchy
of creative minds, it is the presence of the highest
faculty that gives first rank, in virtue of its kind, not
degree; no pretension of a lower nature, whatever the
completeness of development or variety of effect,
impeding the precedency of the rarer endowment
though only in the germ." And, last, of the tardy
recognition of Shelley's genius as a poet, Browning
wrote in words which though, as he himself says, he
had always good praisers, no doubt express a thought
that helped to sustain him against the indifference of
the public to his poetry: "The misapprehensiveness of
<a name="Page_148"></a>his age is exactly what a poet is sent to
remedy: and
the interval between his operation and the generally
perceptible effect of it, is no greater, less indeed than
in many other departments of the great human effort.
The 'E pur si muove' of the astronomer was as bitter
a word as any uttered before or since by a poet over
his rejected living work, in that depth of conviction
which is so like despair." The volume in which
Browning's essay appeared was withdrawn from
circulation on the discovery of the fraudulent nature
of its contents. He had himself no opportunity of
inspecting the forged manuscripts, and no question of
authenticity was raised until several copies of the book
had passed into circulation.<a name="FNanchor_48"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>
<p>During the nine months spent in Paris, from
September 1851 to June 1852, Browning enlarged
the circle of his friends and made some new and
interesting acquaintances. Chief among friendships
was that with Joseph Milsand of Dijon, whose name
is connected with <i>Sordello</i> in the edition of Browning's
"Poetical Works" of the year 1863. Under the title
"La Po&eacute;sie Anglaise depuis Byron," two articles by
Milsand were contributed to the "Revue des Deux
Mondes," the first on Tennyson, the second (published
15th August 1851) a little before the poet's arrival in
Paris, on Robert Browning. "Of all the poets known
to me," wrote his French critic, "he is the most capable
of summing up the conceptions of the religion, the
ethics, and the theoretic knowledge of our period in
forms which embody the beauty proper to such abstractions."
Such criticism by a thoughtful student
<a name="Page_149"></a>of our literature could not but prepare the way
pleasantly for personal acquaintance. Milsand, we
are told by his friend Th. Bentzon (Mme. Blanc),
having hesitated as to the propriety of printing a
passage in an article as yet unpublished, in which he
had spoken of the great sorrow of Mrs Browning's
early life&#8212;the death of her brother, went straight to
Browning, who was then in Paris, and declared that he
was ready to cancel what he had written if it would
cause her pain. "Only a Frenchman," exclaimed
Browning, grasping both hands of his visitor, "would
have done this." So began a friendship of an intimate
and most helpful kind, which closed only with Milsand's
death in 1886. To his memory is dedicated the
volume published soon after his death, <i>Parleyings
with certain People of Importance</i>. "I never knew or
shall know his like among men," wrote Browning;
and again: "No words can express the love I have
for him." And in <i>Red Cotton Nightcap Country</i> it is
Milsand who is characterised in the lines:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>He knows more and loves better than the world<br />
</span><span>That never heard his name and never may, ...<br />
</span><span>What hinders that my heart relieve itself,<br />
</span><span>O friend! who makest warm my wintry world,<br />
</span><span>And wise my heaven, if there we consort too.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>In the correction of Browning's proof-sheets, and
especially in regulating the punctuation of his poems,
Milsand's friendly services were of high value. In
1858 when Browning happened to be at Dijon, and
had reason to believe, though in fact erroneously,
that his friend was absent in Paris, he went twice "in
a passion of friendship," as his wife tells a correspon<a
 name="Page_150"></a>dent,
to stand before Maison Milsand, and muse, and
bless the threshold.<a name="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>
<p>Browning desired much to know Victor Hugo, but
his wish was never gratified. After December 2nd
Paris could not contain a spirit so fiery as Hugo's
was in hostility to the new r&eacute;gime and its chief
representative. Balzac, whom it would have been
a happiness even to look at, was dead. Lamartine
promised a visit, but for a time his coming was
delayed. By a mischance Alfred de Musset failed
to appear when Browning, expecting to meet him, was
the guest of M. Buloz. But B&eacute;ranger was to be seen
"in his white hat wandering along the asphalte." The
blind historian Thierry begged Browning and his wife
to call upon him. At the house of Ary Scheffer, the
painter, they heard Mme. Viardot sing; and receptions
given by Lady Elgin and Mme. Mohl were means of
introduction to much that was interesting in the social
life of Paris. At the theatre they saw with the
deepest excitement "La Dame aux Cam&eacute;lias," which
was running its hundred nights. Caricatures in the
streets exhibited the occupants of the pit protected by
umbrellas from the rain of tears that fell from the
boxes. Tears, indeed, ran down Browning's cheeks,
though he had believed himself hardened against theatrical
pathos. Mrs Browning cried herself ill, and pronounced
the play painful but profoundly moral.</p>
<p>Mrs Browning's admiration of the writings of
George Sand was so great that it would have been a
sore disappointment to her if George Sand were to
prove inaccessible. A letter of introduction to her
<a name="Page_151"></a>had been obtained from Mazzini. "Ah, I am so
vexed
about George Sand," Mrs Browning wrote on Christmas
Eve; "she came, she has gone, and we haven't
met." In February she again was known to be for a
few days in Paris; Browning was not eager to push
through difficulties on the chance of obtaining an
interview, but his wife was all impatience: "' No,' said
I, 'you <i>shan't</i> be proud, and I <i>won't</i> be proud, and we
<i>will</i> see her. I won't die, if I can help it, without
seeing George Sand.'" A gracious reply and an
appointment came in response to their joint-petition
which accompanied Mazzini's letter. On the appointed
Sunday Browning and Mrs Browning&#8212;she wearing a
respirator and smothered in furs&#8212;drove to render
their thanks and homage to the most illustrious of
Frenchwomen. Mrs Browning with beating heart
stooped and kissed her hand. They found in George
Sand's face no sweetness, but great moral and intellectual
capacities; in manners and conversation she
was absolutely simple. Young men formed the
company, to whom she addressed counsel and command
with the utmost freedom and a conscious
authority. Through all her speech a certain undercurrent
of scorn, a half-veiled touch of disdain, was
perceptible. At their parting she invited the English
visitors to come again, kissed Mrs Browning on the
lips, and received Browning's kiss upon her hand.
The second call upon her was less agreeable. She sat
warming her feet in a circle of eight or nine ill-bred
men, representatives of "the ragged Red diluted with
the lower theatrical." If any other mistress of a
house had behaved so unceremoniously, Browning
declared that he would have walked out of the room;
<a name="Page_152"></a>and Mrs Browning left with the impression&#8212;"she
does not care for me." They had exerted themselves
to please her, but felt that it was in vain; "we
couldn't penetrate, couldn't really <i>touch</i> her." Once
Browning met her near the Tuileries and walked the
length of the gardens with her arm upon his. If
nothing further was to come of it, at least they had seen
a wonderful piece of work, which not to have been
blest withal would have discredited their travel. Only
to Mrs Browning's mortification the spectacle wanted
one detail indispensable to its completeness&#8212;the characteristic
cigarette was absent: "Ah, but I didn't see
her smoke." Life leaves us always something to desire.</p>
<p>Before the close of June 1852 they were again in
London, and found comfortable rooms at 58 Welbeck
Street. When the turmoil of the first days had
subsided, they visited "Kenyon the Magnificent"&#8212;so
named by Browning&#8212;at Wimbledon, at whose
table Landor, abounding in life and passionate energy
as in earlier days, was loud in his applause of the
genius of Louis Napoleon. Mazzini, his "intense eyes
full of melancholy illusions," called at their lodgings
in company with Mrs Carlyle, who seemed to Mrs
Browning not only remarkable for her play of ideas
but attaching through her feelings and her character.<a
 name="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a>
Florence Nightingale was also a welcome visitor, and
her visit was followed by a gift of flowers. Invitations
<a name="Page_153"></a>from country houses came in sheaves, and the
thought
of green fields is seductive in a London month of July;
but to remain in London was to be faithful to Penini&#8212;and
to the much-travelled Flush. Once the whole
household, with Flush included, breathed rural air for
two days with friends at Farnham, and Browning had
there the pleasure of meeting Charles Kingsley, whose
Christian Socialism seemed wild and unpractical
enough, but as for the man himself, brave, bold,
original, full of a genial kindliness, Mrs Browning
assures a correspondent that he could not be other
than "good and noble let him say or dream what he
will." It is stated by Mr W.M. Rossetti that Browning
first became acquainted with his brother Dante
Gabriel in the course of this summer. Coventry
Patmore gave him the manuscript of his unpublished
poems of 1853 to read. And Ruskin was now added
to the number of his personal acquaintances. "We
went to Denmark Hill yesterday, by agreement,"
wrote Mrs Browning in September, "to see the
Turners&#8212;which, by the way, are divine. I like Mr
Ruskin much, and so does Robert. Very gentle, yet
earnest&#8212;refined and truthful." At Lord Stanhope's
they were introduced to the latest toy of fashionable
occultism, the crystal ball, in which the seer beheld
Oremus, the spirit of the sun; the supernatural was
qualified for the faithful with luncheon and lobster
salad; "I love the marvellous," Mrs Browning frankly
declares. And of terrestrial wonders, with heaven
lying about them, and also India muslin and Brussels
lace, two were seen in the babies of Monckton Milnes
and Alfred Tennyson. Pen, because he was "troppo
grande," declined to kiss the first of these new-<a name="Page_154"></a>christened
wonders, but Pen's father, who went alone to
the baptism of Hallam Tennyson, distinguished himself
by nursing for some ten minutes and with accomplished
dexterity, the future Governor-General of Australia.</p>
<p>Yet with all these distractions, perhaps in part
because of them, the visit to England was not one of
Browning's happiest times. The autumn weather
confined Mrs Browning to her rooms. He was
anxious, vexed, and worn.<a name="FNanchor_51"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> It was a happiness when
Welbeck Street was left behind, and they were on the
way by Paris to their resting-place at Casa Guidi.
From a balcony overlooking one of the Paris
boulevards they witnessed, in a blaze of autumnal
sunshine, which glorified much military and civic
pomp, the reception of the new Emperor. Mrs
Browning's handkerchief waved frantically while she
prayed that God might bless the people in this the
chosen representative of a democracy. What were
Browning's thoughts on that memorable Saturday is
not recorded, but we may be sure that they were less
enthusiastic. Yet he enjoyed the stir and animation
of Paris, and after the palpitating life of the boulevards
found Florence dull and dead&#8212;no change, no variety.
The journey by the Mont Cenis route had not been
without its trying incidents. At Genoa, during several
days he was deeply depressed by the illness of his
wife, who lay on the sofa and seemed to waste away.
But Casa Guidi was reached at last, where it was more
like summer than November; the pleasant nest had
its own peculiar welcome for wanderers; again they enjoyed
the sunsets over the Arno, and Mrs Browning was
able to report herself free from cough and feeling very
<a name="Page_155"></a>well and very happy: "You can't think how we
have
caught up our ancient traditions just where we left them,
and relapsed into our former soundless, stirless, hermit
life. Robert has not passed an evening from home
since we came&#8212;just as if we had never known Paris."<a name="FNanchor_52"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>
<p>The political condition of Italy was, indeed, a grief
to both husband and wife. It was a state of utter
prostration&#8212;on all sides "the unanimity of despair."
The Grand Duke, the emancipator, had acquired a
respect and affection for the bayonets of Austria.
The Pope was "wriggling his venom into the heart of
all possibilities of free-thought and action." Browning
groaned "How long, O Lord, how long?" His
home-thoughts of England in contrast with Italy were
those of patriotism and pride. His wife was more
detached, more critical towards her native land. The
best symptom for Italian freedom was that if Italy
had not energy to act, she yet had energy to hate.
To be happy now they both must turn to imaginative
work, and gain all the gains possible from
private friendships. Browning was already occupied
with the poems included afterwards in
the volumes of <i>Men and Women</i>. Mrs Browning
was already engaged upon <i>Aurora Leigh</i>. "We
neither of us show our work to one another," she
wrote, "till it is finished. An artist must, I fancy,
either find or <i>make</i> a solitude to work in, if it is to be
good work at all." But as her husband's poems, one
by one, were completed, she saw them, and they
seemed to her as fine as anything he had done.
Away in England <i>Colombe's Birthday</i> was given on
the stage, with Helen Faucit in the leading part.
<a name="Page_156"></a>It was at least an indication that the public
had
not forgotten that Browning was a poet. Here
in Florence, although the hermit life was happy,
new friends&#8212;the gift of England&#8212;added to its
happiness. Frederick Tennyson, the Laureate's
brother, and himself a true poet in his degree, "a
dreamy, shy, speculative man," simple withal and
truthful, had married an Italian wife and was settled
for a time in Florence. To him Browning became
attached with genuine affection. Mrs Browning was
a student of the writings of Swedenborg, and she
tells much of her new friend in a single Swedenborgian
word&#8212;"selfhood, the <i>proprium</i>, is not in
him." Frederick Tennyson, though left in a state of
bewilderment by Browning's poetry, found the writer
of the poetry "a man of infinite learning, jest and
bonhommie, and moreover a sterling heart that reverbs
no hollowness."<a name="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
Another intimate who charmed
them much was one of the attach&eacute;s of the English
embassy, and a poet of unquestionable faculty, very
young, very gentle and refined, delicate and excitable,
full of sensibility, "full of all sorts of goodness and
nobleness," but somewhat dreamy and unpractical,
"visionary enough," writes Mrs Browning, "to suit
me," interested moreover in spiritualism, which suited
her well, "never," she unwisely prophesied, "to be a
great diplomatist." It was hardly, Mr Kenyon, the
editor of her letters, observes, a successful horoscope
of the destiny of Lord Lytton, the future Ambassador
at Paris and Viceroy of India.<a name="FNanchor_54"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>
<p><a name="Page_157"></a>Early in 1853 Mrs Browning became much
interested in the reports which reached her&#8212;many
of these from America&#8212;of the "rapping spirits," who
in the 'fifties were busy in instructing chairs and tables
to walk in the way they should not go. "You know
I am rather a visionary," she wrote to Miss Mitford,
"and inclined to knock round at all the doors of the
present world to try to get out." Her Swedenborgian
studies had prepared her to believe that there were
communities of life in the visible and the invisible
worlds which did not permit of the one being wholly
estranged from the other. A clever person who loves
the marvellous will soon find by the sheer force of
logic that marvels are the most natural things in the
world. Should we not credit human testimony?
Should we not evict prejudice from our understandings?
Should we not investigate alleged facts?
Should we not keep an open mind? We cannot but
feel a certain sympathy with a woman of ardent nature
who fails to observe the bounds of intellectual
prudence. Browning himself with all his audacities
was pre-eminently prudent. He did not actively enter
into politics; he did not dabble in pseudo-science; he
was an artist and a thinker; and he made poems, and
amused himself with drawing, modelling in clay, and
the study of music. Mrs Browning squandered her
enthusiasms with less discretion. A good dose of
stupidity or an indignant energy of common-sense,
impatient of the nonsense of the thing, may be the
salvation of the average man. It is often the clever
people who would be entirely rational and unprejudiced
that best succeed in duping themselves at once by
their reason and their folly. A fine old crusted pre<a name="Page_158"></a>judice
commonly stands for a thousand acts of judgment
amassed into a convenient working result; a
single act of an individual understanding, or several
of such acts, will seldom contain an equal sum of
wisdom. Scientific discovery is not advanced by a
multitude of curious and ingenious amateurs in learned
folly. Whether the claims of spiritualism are warrantable
or fallacious, Mrs Browning, gifted as she was with
rare powers of mind, was not qualified to investigate
those claims; it was a waste of energy, from which
she could not but suffer serious risks and certain loss.</p>
<p>Before she had seen anything for herself she was a
believer&#8212;a believer, as she describes it, on testimony.
The fact of communication with the invisible world
appeared to her more important than anything that
had been communicated. The spirits themselves
"seem abundantly foolish, one must admit." Yet it
was clear to her that mankind was being prepared for
some great development of truth. She would keep
her eyes wide open to facts and her soul lifted up in
reverential expectation. By-and-by she felt the dumb
wood of the table panting and shivering with human
emotion. The dogmatism of Faraday in an inadequate
theory was simply unscientific, a piece of intellectual
tyranny. The American medium Home, she learnt
from her friends, was "turning the world upside down
in London with this spiritual influx." Two months
later, in July 1855, Mrs Browning and her husband
were themselves in London, and witnessed Home's
performances during a s&eacute;ance at Ealing. Miss de
Gaudrion (afterwards Mrs Merrifield), who was present
on that occasion, and who was convinced that the
"manifestations" were a fraud, wrote to Mrs Browning
<a name="Page_159"></a>for an expression of her opinion. The reply, as
might
be expected, declared the writer's belief in the genuine
character of the phenomena; such manifestations, she
admitted, in the undeveloped state of the subject were
"apt to be low"; but they were, she was assured, "the
beginning of access from a spiritual world, of which
we shall presently learn more perhaps." A letter
volunteered by Browning accompanied that of his
wife. He had, he said, to overcome a real repugnance
in recalling the subject; he could hardly understand
how another opinion was possible than that "the
whole display of 'hands,' 'spirit utterances,' etc., was
a cheat and imposture." It was all "melancholy stuff,"
which a grain of worldly wisdom would dispose of in
a minute. "Mr Browning," the letter goes on, "has,
however, abundant experience that the best and rarest
of natures may begin by the proper mistrust of the
more ordinary results of reasoning when employed in
such investigations as these, go on to an abnegation
of the regular tests of truth and rationality in favour
of these particular experiments, and end in a voluntary
prostration of the whole intelligence before what is
assumed to transcend all intelligence. Once arrived
at this point, no trick is too gross&#8212;absurdities are
referred to 'low spirits,' falsehoods to 'personating
spirits'&#8212;and the one terribly apparent spirit, the
Father of Lies, has it all his own way." These
interesting letters were communicated to <i>The Times</i>
by Mr Merrifield (<i>Literary Supplement</i>, Nov. 28,
1902), and they called forth a short additional letter
from Mr R. Barrett Browning, the "Penini" of earlier
days. He mentions that his father had himself on
one occasion detected Home in a vulgar fraud; that
<a name="Page_160"></a>Home had called at the house of the Brownings,
and
was turned out of it. Mr Browning adds: "What,
however, I am more desirous of stating is that towards
the end of her life my mother's views on 'spiritual
manifestations' were much modified. This change
was brought about, in great measure, by the discovery
that she had been duped by a friend in whom she had
blind faith. The pain of the disillusion was great, but
her eyes were opened and she saw clearly."<a name="FNanchor_55"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> It must
be added, that letters written by Mrs Browning six
months before her death give no indication of this
change of feeling, but she admits that "sublime communications"
from the other world are "decidedly
absent," and that while no truth can be dangerous,
unsettled minds may lose their balance, and may do
wisely to avoid altogether the subject of spiritualism.</p>
<p>Browning's hostility arose primarily from his conviction
that the so-called "manifestations" were, as he
says, a cheat and imposture. He had grasped Home's
leg under the table while at work in producing "phenomena."
He had visited his friend, Seymour Kirkup,
had found the old man assisting at the trance of a
peasant girl named Mariana; and when Kirkup withdrew
for a moment, the entranced Mariana relieved
herself from the fatigue of her posturing, at the same
time inviting Browning with a wink to be a charitable
confederate in the joke by which she profited in admiration
and in pelf. Browning, who would have
waged immitigable war against the London dog-stealers,
and opposed all treaty with such rogues, even at the
cost of an unrecovered Flush, could not but oppose
the new trade of elaborate deception. But his feeling
<a name="Page_161"></a>was intensified by the personal repulsiveness of
the
professional medium. The vain, sleek, vulgar, emasculated,
neurotic type of creature, who became the
petted oracle of the dim-lighted room, was loathsome
in his eyes. And his respect for his wife's genius
made him feel that there was a certain desecration in
the neighbourhood to her of men whom he regarded
as verminous impostors. Yet he recognised her right
to think for herself, and she, on the other hand,
regarded his scepticism as rather his misfortune than
his crime.</p>
<p>It was a considerable time after his wife's death
that Browning's study of the impostor of the spiritualist
circles, "Mr Sludge the Medium," appeared in the
<i>Dramatis Personae</i> of 1864; the date of its composition
is Rome, 1859-60; but the observations which
that study sums up were accumulated during earlier
years, and if Mr Sludge is not a portrait of Home, that
eminent member of the tribe of Sludge no doubt
supplied suggestions for the poet's character-study.
Browning evidently wrote the poem with a peculiar
zest; its intellectual energy never flags; its imaginative
grip never slackens. If the Bishop, who orders
his tomb at St Praxed's, serves to represent the
sensuous glory and the moral void of one phase of the
Italian Renaissance, so, and with equal fidelity, does
Mr Sludge represent a phase of nineteenth century
materialism and moral grossness, which cannot extinguish
the cravings of the soul but would vulgarise
and degrade them with coarse illusions. Unhappily
the later poem differs from the earlier in being uglier
in its theme and of inordinate length. Browning,
somewhat in the manner of Ben Jonson when he
<a name="Page_162"></a>wrote <i>The Alchemist</i>, could not be
satisfied until he
had exhausted the subject to the dregs. The writer's
zeal from first to last knows no abatement, but it is
not every reader who cares to bend over the
dissecting-table, with its sick effluvia, during so
prolonged a demonstration.</p>
<p>"Mr Sludge the Medium" is not a mere attack on
spiritualism; it is a dramatic scene in the history of a
soul; and Browning, with his democratic feeling in
things of the mind, held that every soul however mean
is worth understanding. If the poem is a satire, it is
so only in a way that is inevitable. Browning's desire
is to be absolutely just, but sometimes truth itself
becomes perforce a satire. He takes an impostor at
the moment of extreme disadvantage; the "medium"
is caught in the very act of cheating; he will make a
clean breast of it; and his confession is made as nearly
as possible a vindication. The most contemptible of
creatures, in desperate straits, makes excellent play
with targe and dagger; the poetry of the piece is to
be found in the lithe attitudes, absolutely the best
possible under the circumstances, by which he maintains
both defence and attack. Half of the long <i>apologia</i> is
a criticism not of those who feast fools in their folly,
but of the fools who require a caterer for the feast; it
is a study of the methods by which dupes solicit and
educate a knave. The other half is Sludge's plea that,
knave though he be, he is not wholly knave; and
Browning, while absolutely rejecting the doctrine of so called
spiritualism, is prepared to admit that in the
composition of a Sludge there enters a certain portion
of truth, low in degree, perverted in kind, inoperative
to the ends of truth, yet a fragment of that without
<a name="Page_163"></a>which life itself were impossible even for the
meanest
organism in the shape of man.</p>
<p>Cowardly, cunning, insolent, greedy, effeminately
sensual, playing upon the vanity of his patrons,
playing upon their vulgar sentimentality, playing upon
their vulgar pietisms and their vulgar materialism,
Sludge after all is less the wronger than the wronged.
Who made him what he is? Who, keen and clear-sighted
enough in fields which they had not selected
as their special parade-ground for self-conceit, trained
him on to knavery and self-degradation? Who helped
him through his blunders with ingenious excuses&#8212;"the
manifestations are at first so weak"; or "Sludge is
himself disturbed by the strange phenomena"; or "a
doubter is in the company, and the spirits have grown
confused in their communications"? Who proceeded
to exhibit him as a lawful prize and possession,
staking their vanity on the success of his imposture?
Who awakened in him the artist's joy in rare invention?
Who urged him forward from modest to magnificent
lies? Who fed and flattered him? What ladies
bestowed their soft caresses on Sludge? And now
and again in his course of fraud did he not turn a
wistful eye towards any reckless tatterdemalion, if only
the vagrant lived in freedom and in truth?</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>It's too bad, I say,<br />
</span><span>Ruining a soul so!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>And in the midst of gulls who persistently refuse
to be undeceived cheating is so "cruel easy." The
difficulty is rather that the cheating, even when
acknowledged, should ever be credited for what it
is. The medium has confessed! Yes, and to cheat
<a name="Page_164"></a>may be part of the medium nature; none the less
he
has the medium's gift of acting as a conductor between
the visible and the invisible worlds. Has he not told
secrets of the lives of his wondering clients which could
not have been known by natural means? And Sludge
chuckles "could not?"&#8212;could not be known by him
who in his seeming passivity is alive at every nerve with
the instinct of the detective, by him whose trade was</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Throwing thus<br />
</span><span>His sense out, like an ant-eater's long tongue,<br />
</span><span>Soft, innocent, warm, moist, impassible,<br />
</span><span>And when 'twas crusted o'er with creatures&#8212;slick,<br />
</span><span>Their juice enriched his palate. "Could not Sludge!"<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Haunters of the s&eacute;ance of every species are his
aiders and abettors&#8212;the unbeliever, whom believers
overwhelm or bribe to acquiescence, the fair votaries
who find prurient suggestions characteristic of the
genuine medium, the lover of the lie through the
natural love of it, the amateur, incapable of a real
conviction, who plays safely with superstition, the
literary man who welcomes a new flavour for the
narrative or the novel, the philosophic diner-out, who
wants the chopping-block of a disputable doctrine on
which to try the edge of his faculty. Is it his part,
Sludge asks indignantly, to be grateful to the patrons
who have corrupted and debased him?</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Gratitude to these?<br />
</span><span>The gratitude, forsooth, of a prostitute<br />
</span><span>To the greenhorn and the bully.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The truculence of Sludge is not without warrant;
it is indeed no other than the truculence of Robert
Browning, "shaking his mane," as Dante Rossetti
<a name="Page_165"></a>described him in his outbreaks against the
spiritualists,
"with occasional foamings at the mouth."<a name="FNanchor_56"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>
<p>Where then is the little grain of truth which has
vitality amid the putrefaction of Sludge's nature?
Liar and cheat as he is, he cannot be sure "but there
was something in it, tricks and all." The spiritual
world, he feels, is as real as the material world; the
supernatural interpenetrates the natural at every point;
in little things, as in great things, God is present.
Sludge is aware of the invisible powers at every nerve:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>I guess what's going on outside the veil,<br />
</span><span>Just as the prisoned crane feels pairing-time<br />
</span><span>In the islands where his kind are, so must fall<br />
</span><span>To capering by himself some shiny night<br />
</span><span>As if your back yard were a plot of spice.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>He cheats; yes, but he also apprehends a truth which
the world is blind to. Or, after all, is this cheating
when every lie is quick with a germ of truth?
Is not such lying as this a self-desecration,
if you will; but still more a strange, sweet self-sacrifice
in the service of truth? At the lowest is
it not required by the very conditions of our poor
mortal life, which remains so sorry a thing, so imperfect,
so unendurable until it is brought into fruitful
connection with a future existence? This world
of ours is a cruel, blundering, unintelligible world;
but let it be pervaded by an influx from the next
world, how quickly it rights itself! how intelligible
it all grows! And is the faculty of imagination, the
faculty which discovers the things of the spirit&#8212;put
to his own uses by the poet and even the historian&#8212;is
<a name="Page_166"></a>this a power which cheats its possessor, or
cheats
those for whose advantage he gives it play?</p>
<p>Browning's design is to exhibit even in this Sludge
the rudiments&#8212;coarse, perverted, abnormally directed
and ineffective for moral good&#8212;of that sublime
spiritual wisdom, which, turned to its proper ends
and aided by the highest intellectual powers, is
present&#8212;to take a lofty exemplar&#8212;in his Pope of
<i>The Ring and the Book</i>. It is not through spiritualism
so-called that Sludge has received his little grain of
truth; that has only darkened the glimmer of true
light which was in him. Yet liar and cheat and coward,
he is saved from a purely phantasmal existence by
this fibre of reality which was part of his original
structure. The epilogue&#8212;Sludge's outbreak against
his corrupter and tormentor&#8212;stands as evidence of
the fact that no purifying, no cleansing, no really
illuminating power remains in what is now only a
putrescent luminosity within him. His rage is natural
and dramatically true; a noble rage would be to his
honour. This is a base and poisonous passion with
no virtue in it, and the passion, flaring for a moment,
sinks idly into as base a fingering of Sludge's
disgraceful gains.</p>

<h5>THE VIA BOCCA DI LEONE, ROME, IN WHICH THE BROWNINGS
STAYED.</h5>
<h5><i>From a photograph.</i></h5>
<p>The summer and early autumn of 1853 were
spent by Browning and his wife, as they had spent
the same season four years previously, at the Baths
of Lucca. Their house among the hills was shut in
by a row of plane-trees in which by day the cicale
were shrill; at evening fireflies lit up their garden.
The green rushing river&#8212;"a flashing scimitar that
cuts through the mountain"&#8212;the chestnut woods,
the sheep-walks, "the villages on the peaks of the
<a name="Page_167"></a>mountains like wild eagles," renewed their
former
delights.</p>
<p>On the longer excursions Browning slackened his
footsteps to keep pace with his wife's donkey; basins
of strawberries and cream refreshed the wanderers
after their exertion. "Oh those jagged mountains,"
exclaims Mrs Browning, "rolled together like pre-Adamite
beasts, and setting their teeth against the
sky.... You may as well guess at a lion by a
lady's lap-dog as at Nature by what you see in
England. All honour to England, lanes and meadowland,
notwithstanding. To the great trees above all."
The sculptor Story and his family, whose acquaintance
they had made in Florence before Casa Guidi
had become their home, were their neighbours
at the Baths, and Robert Lytton was for a time
their guest. Browning worked at his <i>Men and Women</i>,
of which his wife was able to report in the autumn
that it was in an advanced state. <i>In a Balcony</i> was
the most important achievement of the summer.
"The scene of the declaration in <i>By the Fireside</i>"
Mrs Orr informs us, "was laid in a little adjacent
mountain-gorge to which Browning walked or rode."</p>
<p>Only a few weeks were given to Florence. In
perfect autumnal weather the occupants of Casa Guidi
started for Rome. The delightful journey occupied
eight days, and on the way the church of Assisi was
seen, and the falls of Terni&#8212;"that passion of the
waters,"&#8212;so Mrs Browning describes it, "which makes
the human heart seem so still." They entered Rome
in a radiant mood.&#8212;"Robert and Penini singing."
An apartment had been taken for them by their
friends the Storys in the Via Bocca di Leone, and
<a name="Page_168"></a>all was bright, warm, and full of comfort. Next
morning a shadow fell upon their happiness&#8212;the
Storys' little boy was seized with convulsions; in the
evening he was dead.<a name="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a>
A second child&#8212;a girl&#8212;was
taken ill in the Brownings' house, and could not be
moved from where she lay in a room below their
apartment. Mrs Browning was in a panic for her
own boy, though his apple-red cheeks spoke of health.
Rome, for a time, was darkened with grief and
anxiety; nor did the city itself impress her as she
had expected: "It's a palimpsest Rome," she writes,
"a watering-place written over the antique." The
chief gains of these Roman months were those of
friendship and pleasant acquaintances added to those
already given by Italy. In rooms under those
occupied by the Brownings was Page the American
artist, who painted in colours then regarded as
"Venetian," now almost darkened out of existence,
as a gift for Mrs Browning, the portrait of Robert
Browning exhibited in the Royal Academy of
1856. Browning himself wrote to Story with enthusiasm
of Page's work. "I am much disappointed
in it," wrote Dante Rossetti to Allingham, "and shall
advise its non-exhibition." A second portrait painted
at this time&#8212;that by Fisher&#8212;is familiar to us through
a reproduction in the second volume of <i>The Letters of
Mrs Browning</i>. A rash act of the morning of the day
on which he entered Rome had deplorably altered
Browning's appearance. In what his wife calls a fit
of suicidal impatience, he perpetrated the high crime
and misdemeanour, and appeared before her wholly
<a name="Page_169"></a>unworthy of portraiture with clean-shaven cheeks
and chin. "I cried when I saw him," she tells his
sister, "I was so horror-struck." To mark the sin,
his beard, when once again he recovered his good
looks, was gray, but Mrs Browning cherished the
opinion that the argentine touch, as she terms it, gave
"a character of elevation and thought to his whole
physiognomy." To complete this history, it may be
added that in 1859 the moustache of his later portraits
was first doubtfully permitted and was presently
approved with decision as picturesque.<a name="FNanchor_58"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>
<p>Under all disadvantages of appearance Browning
made his way triumphantly in the English and
American society of Rome. The studios were open
to him. In Gibson's he saw the tinted Venus&#8212;"rather
a grisette than a goddess," pronounced Mrs
Browning. Harriet Hosmer, the young American
sculptress, working with true independence, high aims
and right woman's manliness, was both admired and
loved. Thackeray, with his daughters, called at the
apartment in the Bocca di Leone, bringing small-talk
in "handfuls of glittering dust swept out of salons."
Lockhart, snow-white in aspect, snow-cold in manner,
gave Browning emphatic commendation, though of a
negative kind&#8212;"He isn't at all," declared Lockhart,
"like a damned literary man." But of many interesting
acquaintances perhaps the most highly valued
were Fanny Kemble and her sister Adelaide Sartoris&#8212;Fanny
Kemble magnificent, "with her black hair
and radiant smile," her sympathetic voice, "her eyes and
eyelids full of utterance"&#8212;a very noble creature indeed;
Mrs Sartoris, genial and generous, more tolerant
<a name="Page_170"></a>than Fanny of Mrs Browning's wayward
enthusiasms,
eloquent in talk and passionate in song. "The
Kembles," writes Mrs Browning, "were our gain in
Rome."</p>
<p>Towards the end of May 1854 farewells were said,
and the Brownings returned from Rome, to Florence
by vettura. They had hoped to visit England, or
if this should prove impracticable, to take shelter
among the mountains from the summer heat. But
needful coin on which they had reckoned did not
arrive; and they resolved in prudence to sit still at
Florence and eat their bread and macaroni as poor
sensible folk should do. And Florence looked more
beautiful than ever after Rome; the nightingales sang
around the olive-trees and vineyards, not only by
starlight and fire-fly-light but in the daytime. "I
love the very stones of Florence," exclaims Mrs
Browning. Her friend Miss Mitford, now in England,
and sadly failing in health, hinted at a loan of money;
but the answer was a prompt, "Oh no! My husband
has a family likeness to Lucifer in being proud."
There followed a tranquil and a happy time, and both
<i>Men and Women</i> and <i>Aurora Leigh</i> maintained in the
writers a deep inward excitement of the kind that
leaves an enduring result. A little joint publication;
<i>Two Poems by E.B.B. and R.B</i>., containing <i>A Plea
for the Ragged Schools of London</i> and <i>The Twins</i>, was
sold at Miss Arabella Barrett's Ragged School bazaar
in 1854. It is now a waif of literature which collectors
prize. There is special significance in the <i>Date</i> and
<i>Dabitur</i>, the twins of Browning's poem, when we
bear in mind the occasion with which it was originally
connected.</p>
<p><a name="Page_171"></a>In the early weeks of 1855 Mrs Browning was
seriously ill; through feverish nights of coughing, she
had in her husband a devoted nurse. His sleepless
hours were troubled not only by anxiety on her
account but by a passionate interest in the heroisms
and miseries, of his fellow countrymen during the
Crimean winter: "when he is mild <i>he</i> wishes the
ministry to be torn to pieces in the streets, limb from
limb." Gradually his wife regained health, but she had
not long recovered when tidings of the death of Miss
Mitford came to sadden her. Not until April did she
feel once more a leap into life. Browning was now
actively at work in anticipation of printing his new
volumes during the approaching visit to England.
"He is four hours a day," his wife tells a correspondent,
"engaged in dictating to a friend of ours who transcribes
for him." And a little later she reports that
they will take to England between them some sixteen
thousand lines of verse, "eight on one side, eight on
the other," her husband's total being already completed,
her own still short of the sum by a thousand lines.
Allowance, as she pleads, had to be made for time
spent in seeing that "Penini's little trousers are
creditably frilled and tucked." On the whole, notwithstanding
illness and wrath directed against English
ministerial blunders, this year of life in Florence had
been rich in happiness&#8212;a "still dream-life, where if
one is over-busy ever, the old tapestries on the walls
and the pre-Giotto pictures ... surround us, ready
to quiet us again."<a name="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>
London lodgings did not look
inviting from the distance of Italy; but the summons
north was a summons to work, and could not be set aside.</p>
<p><a name="Page_172"></a>The midsummer of 1855 found Browning and his
wife in 13 Dorset Street, London, and Browning's
sister was with them. The faithful Wilson, Mrs
Browning's maid, had married a Florentine, Ferdinando
Romagnoli, and the husband also was now in their
service. The weeks until mid-October were occupied
with social pleasures and close proof-reading of the
sheets of <i>Men and Women</i><a name="FNanchor_60"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> Browning took his young
friend the artist Leighton to visit Ruskin, and was
graciously received. Carlyle was, as formerly, "in
great force, particularly in the damnatory clauses."
But the weather was drooping, the skies misty, the
air oppressive, and Mrs Browning, apart from these,
had special causes of depression. Her married sister
Henrietta was away in Taunton, and the cost of travel
prevented the sisters from meeting. Arabella Barrett&#8212;"my
one light in London" is Mrs Browning's
word&#8212;was too soon obliged to depart to Eastbourne.
And the Barrett household was disturbed by the undutifulness
of a son who had been guilty of the unpardonable
crime of marriage, and in consequence was
now exiled from Wimpole Street. In body and soul
Mrs Browning felt strong yearnings for the calm of
Casa Guidi.</p>
<p>The year 1855 was a fortunate year for English
poetry. <i>Men and Women</i> was published in the
autumn; the beautiful epilogue, addressed to E.B.B.,
"There they are, my fifty men and women," was
written in Dorset Street. Tennyson's <i>Maud</i> had preceded
Browning's volumes by some months. It bewildered
the critics, but his brother poet did justice to
<a name="Page_173"></a>Tennyson's passionate sequence of dramatic
lyrics.
And though London in mid-autumn had emptied
itself Tennyson happened for a few days to be in
town. Two evenings he gave to the Brownings, "dined
with us," writes Mrs Browning, "smoked with us,
opened his heart to us (and the second bottle of port),
and ended by reading <i>Maud</i> through from end to end,
and going away at half-past two in the morning."
His delightful frankness and simplicity charmed his
hostess. "Think of his stopping in <i>Maud</i>," she goes
on, "every now and then&#8212;'There's a wonderful
touch! That's very tender! How beautiful that is!'
Yes and it <i>was</i> wonderful, tender, beautiful, and he
read exquisitely in a voice like an organ, rather music
than speech."</p>
<p>One of the few persons who were invited to meet
Tennyson on this occasion, Mr W.M. Rossetti, is still
living, and his record of that memorable evening
ought not to be omitted. "The audience was a
small one, the privilege accorded to each individual all
the higher: Mr and Mrs Browning, Miss Browning,
my brother, and myself, and I think there was one
more&#8212;either Madox Brown or else [Holman] Hunt
or Woolner ... Tennyson, seated on a sofa in a
characteristic attitude, and holding the volume near
his eyes ... read <i>Maud</i> right through. My brother
made two pen-and-ink sketches of him, and gave one
of them to Browning. So far as I remember, the
Poet-Laureate neither saw what Dante was doing,
nor knew of it afterwards. His deep grand voice,
with slightly chaunting intonation, was a noble vehicle
for the perusal of mighty verse. On it rolled, sonorous
and emotional. Dante Rossetti, according to Mr Hall
<a name="Page_174"></a>Caine, spoke of the incident in these terms: 'I
once
heard Tennyson read <i>Maud</i>; and, whilst the fiery
passages were delivered with a voice and vehemence
which he alone of living men can compass, the softer
passages and the songs made the tears course down
his cheeks.' ... After Tennyson and <i>Maud</i> came
Browning and <i>Fra Lippo Lippi</i>&#8212;read with as much
sprightly variation as there was in Tennyson of
sustained continuity. Truly a night of the gods, not
to be remembered without pride and pang."<a name="FNanchor_61"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> A
quotation from a letter of Dante Rossetti to Allingham
gives praise to Mrs Browning of a kind which resembles
Lockhart's commendation of her husband: "What a
delightful unliterary person Mrs Browning is to meet!
During two evenings when Tennyson was at their
house in London, Mrs Browning left Tennyson with
her husband and William and me (who were the
fortunate remnant of the male party) to discuss the
universe, and gave all her attention to some certainly
not very exciting ladies in the next room."<a name="FNanchor_62"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> Without
detracting from Mrs Browning's "unliterary" merits,
one may conjecture that the ladies who proved unexciting
to Rossetti were Arabella Barrett and
Sarianna Browning.</p>

<h2>Men and Women</h2>
<br />
<p>Rossetti expresses his first enthusiasm about <i>Men
and Women</i> in a word when he calls the poems "my
Elixir of Life." To Ruskin these, with other pieces
which he now read for the first time, were as he
declared in a rebellious mood, a mass of conundrums.
"He compelled me," Rossetti adds, "to sit down
before him and lay siege for one whole night; the
result of which was that he sent me next morning a
bulky letter to be forwarded to Browning, in which I
trust he told him he was the greatest man since
Shakespeare." The poems of the two new volumes
were the gradual growth of a considerable number of
years; since 1845 their author had published no
group of short poems, and now, at the age of forty-three,
he had attained the fulness of intellectual and
imaginative power, varied experience of life and
the artistic culture of Italy. The <i>Dramatis Personae</i>
of 1864 exhibits no decline from the high level
reached in the volumes of 1855; but is there any
later volume of miscellaneous poetry by Browning
which, taken as a whole, approaches in excellence the
collections of 1855 and 1864?</p>
<p>There is no need now to "lay siege" to the poems
of <i>Men and Women</i>; they have expounded themselves,
<a name="Page_176"></a>if ever they needed exposition; and the truth is
that
they are by no means nut-shells into which mottoes
meant for the construing of the intellect have been
inserted, but fruits rich in colour and perfume, a feast
for the imagination, the passions, the spirit in sense,
and also for the faculty of thought which lives in the
heart of these. If a criticism or a doctrine of life lies
in them&#8212;and that it should do so means that the
poet's total mind has been taken up into his art&#8212;Browning
conveys his doctrine not as such but as an
enthusiasm of living; his generalized truth saturates a
medium of passion and of beauty. In the Prologue
to <i>Fifine at the Fair</i> he compares the joy of poetry to
a swimmer's joy in the sea: the vigour that such
disport in sun and sea communicates is the vigour of
joyous play; afterwards, if we please, we can ascertain
the constituents of sea-water by a chemical analysis;
but the analysis will not convey to us the sensations
of the sunshine and the dancing brine. One of the
blank-verse pieces of <i>Men and Women</i> rebukes a
youthful poet of the transcendental school whose
ambition is to set forth "stark-naked thought" in
poetry. Why take the harp to his breast "only to
speak dry words across the strings"? Better hollo
abstract ideas through the six-foot Alpine horn of
prose. Boys may desire the interpretation into bare
ideas of those thronging objects which obsess their
senses and their feelings; men need art for the delight
of it, and the strength which comes through delight.
Better than the meaning of a rose is the rose itself
with its spirit enveloped in colour and perfume. And
so the poet for men will resemble that old mage John
of Halberstadt:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><a name="Page_177"></a><span>He with a 'look you!'
vents a brace of rhymes,<br />
</span><span>And in there breaks the sudden rose herself,<br />
</span><span>Over us, under, round us every side,<br />
</span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span><br />
<br />
</span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span>Buries us with a glory, young once more,<br />
</span><span>Pouring heaven into this shut house of life.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Browning in <i>Men and Women</i> is in truth a John of
Halberstadt; he enriches life with colour, warmth,
music, romance, not dissociated from thought and intellectual
energy, rather possessing and being possessed
by these. Not a single poem is "stark-naked
thought"; not a single poem is addressed solely to
the intellect; even <i>Bishop Blougram</i> is rather a
presentation of character than a train of argument or
a chain of ideas.</p>
<p>In few of these poems does Browning speak in his
own person; the verses addressed to his wife, which
present her with "his fifty men and women" and tell
of mysteries of love that can never be told, the lines,
<i>Memorabilia</i>, addressed to one who had seen Shelley,
and <i>Old Pictures in Florence</i>, are perhaps the only
exceptions to the dramatic character of the contents
of the two volumes. Yet through them all Browning's
mind is clearly discernible; and even his central
convictions, his working creed of life, can with no
sense of uncertainty be gathered from them. To
attribute to the writer the opinions and the feelings of
his <i>dramatis personae</i> would of course be the crudest of
mistakes. But when an idea persists through many
poems written at various times and seasons, when it
appears and reappears under various clothings of
circumstance, when it is employed as if it had a
crucial value, when it becomes a test or touchstone of
character, we cannot doubt that it is an intimate
<a name="Page_178"></a>possession of the writer's mind. Such an idea is
not
a mere playmate but rather a confidant. When,
again, after a tangle of casuistic reasoning or an embroilment
of contending feelings, some idea suddenly
flashes forth, and like a sword sunders truth from
falsehood and darkness from light, we may be assured
that it has more than a dramatic value. And, once
more, if again and again the same idea shows its power
over the feelings and inspires elevated lyrical utterance,
or if in pieces of casuistical brain-work it enters as a
passionate element and domineers by its own authority,
if it originates not debate but song or that from which
song is made, we know that the writer's heart has
embraced it as a truth of the emotions.</p>
<p>Because Browning had his own well-defined view of
truth, he could confidently lend his mind away to his
fifty or his hundred men and women. They served to
give his ideas a concrete body. By sympathy and by
intelligence he widened the basis of his own existence.
If the poet loses himself to find himself again through
sympathy with external nature, how much more and
in how many enriching ways through sympathy with
humanity! Thus new combinations of thought and
feeling are effected. Thus a kind of experiment is
made with our own ideas by watching how they behave
when brought into connection with these new combinations.
Truth is relative, and the best truth of our own
is worth testing under various conditions and circumstances.
The truth or falsehood which is not our own
has a right to say the best for itself that can be said.
Let truth and falsehood grapple. Let us hear the
counter-truth or the rival falsehood which is the
complement or the criticism of our own, and hear it
<a name="Page_179"></a>stated with the utmost skill. A Luther would
surely
be the wiser for an evening spent in company with a
Blougram; and Blougram has things to tell us which
Luther never knew. But precisely because truth is
relative we must finally adhere to our own perceptions;
they constitute the light for us; and the justice
we would do to others we must also render to ourselves.
A wide survey may be made from a fixed
centre. "Universal sympathies," Miss Barrett wrote
in one of the letters to her future husband, "cannot
make a man inconsistent, but on the contrary sublimely
consistent. A church tower may stand between the
mountains and the sea, looking to either, and stand
fast: but the willow tree at the gable-end blown now
toward the north and now toward the south, while its
natural leaning is due east or west, is different altogether
... <i>as</i> different as a willow tree from a
church tower."<a name="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>
<p>The fifty poems of <i>Men and Women</i>, with a few
exceptions, fall into three principal groups&#8212;those
which interpret various careers or moods or moments
of love; those which deal with the fine arts&#8212;painting,
poetry, music&#8212;and with these we may class, as
kindred in spirit, that poem which has for its subject
the passionate pursuit of knowledge, <i>A Grammarian's
Funeral</i>; and thirdly, those which are connected with
religious thought and feeling, or present scenes from
the history of religions. Two poems may be called
descriptive; both are Italian; both are founded upon
a rivalry of contrasts, but one, <i>Up at a Villa&#8212;Down
in the City</i>, is made up of humorous observations of
Italian city and country life, expressing the mundane
<a name="Page_180"></a>tastes and prudent economies of an Italian
person of
quality; the other, "<i>De Gustibus</i>&#8212;," which contrasts
the happy quietudes of English landscape with the
passionate landscape of the South, has romance at the
heart of its realism and an ardour of sentiment underlying
its pictorial vividness. <i>The Patriot</i> is again
Italian, suggested perhaps by the swift revolutions and
restorations which Browning had witnessed in Florence,
and again it uses with striking effect the principle of
contrast; the patriot who a year ago had his intoxicating
triumph is now on his way to the scaffold. His
year's toil for the good of his people has turned into a
year's misdeeds, his life is a failure; but Browning
characteristically wrings a victory out of defeat; the
crowd at the shambles' gate may hoot; it is better so,
for now the martyr can throw himself upon God, the
Paymaster of all his labourers at the close of day.
The most remarkable of these poems, which refuse to
take their places in a group, is that forlorn romance of
weary and depressed heroism, <i>Childe Roland to the
Dark Tower came</i>. It is in the main a fantaisie of
description; but involved with the descriptive study
is a romantic motive. The external suggestions for
the poem were no more than the words from <i>King
Lear</i> which form the title, a tower seen in the Carrara
mountains, a painting seen in Paris, and the figure of
a horse in the tapestry of the drawing-room of Casa
Guidi.<a name="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>
In his own mind Browning may have put
the question: Of all the feats of knight-errantry which
is the hardest? Not to combat with dragons, or
robbers, or salvage men; not to bear down rival
<a name="Page_181"></a>champions in a rapture of battle. Not these, but
to
cling to a purpose amid all that depresses the senses
at a time when the heart within us is also failing; to
advance where there is nothing to arouse energy by
opposition, and everything without and within to sap
the very life of the soul. Childe Roland is himself
hopeless and almost heartless; the plain to which the
leering cripple had pointed and over which he rides
is created in the utter indigence of nature&#8212;a very
nightmare of poverty and mean repulsiveness. And
yet he endures the test, and halts only when he faces
the Dark Tower and blows the blast upon his horn.
Browning was wise to carry his romance no further;
the one moment of action is enough; it is the breaking
of the spell, the waking from the nightmare, and
at that point the long-enduring quester may be left.
We are defrauded of nothing by the abrupt conclusion.</p>
<p>In the poems which treat of the love of man and
woman Browning regards the union of soul with soul
as the capital achievement of life, and also as affording
one of its chief tests. When we have formed these
into a group we perceive that the group falls in the
main into two divisions&#8212;poems which tell of attainment,
and poems which tell of failure or defeat.
Certain persons whose centre is a little hard kernel
of egoism may be wholly disqualified for the test
created by a generous passion. Browning does not
belabour with heavy invective the <i>Pretty Woman</i> of
his poem, who is born without a heart; she is a
flower-like creature and of her kind is perfect; only
the flower is to be gazed at, not gathered; or, if it
must be gathered, then at last to be thrown away.
The chief distinction between the love of man and
<a name="Page_182"></a>the love of woman, implied in various poems, is
this&#8212;the man at his most blissful moment cries
"What treasures I have obtained!" the woman cries
"What treasures have I to surrender and bestow?"
Hence the singleness and finality in the election of
passion made by a woman as compared with a man's
acquisitiveness of delight. The unequal exchange of
a transitory for an enduring surrender of self is the
sorrow which pulsates through the lines of <i>In a Year</i>, as
swift and broken with pauses as the beating of a heart:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Dear, the pang is brief,<br />
</span><span>Do thy part,<br />
</span><span>Have thy pleasure! How perplexed<br />
</span><span>Grows belief!<br />
</span><span>Well, this cold clay clod<br />
</span><span>Was man's heart:<br />
</span><span>Crumble it and what comes next?<br />
</span><span>Is it God?<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>And with no chilling of love on the man's part, this
is the point of central pain, in that poem of exquisite
and pathetic distrust at the heart of trust and admiration,
<i>Any Wife to any Husband</i>; noble and faithful as
the husband has been, still he is only a man. But
elsewhere Browning does justice to the pure chivalry
of a man's devotion. Caponsacchi's joy is the joy of a
saviour who himself is saved; the great event of his
life by which he is lifted above self is single and
ultimate; his soul is delivered from careless egoism
once and for ever; the grace of love is here what the
theologians called invincible grace, and invincible
grace, we know, results in final perseverance. Even
here in <i>Men and Women</i> two contrasted poems assure
us that, while the passion of a man may be no more
<a name="Page_183"></a>than <i>Love in a Life</i>, it may also be an
unweariable
<i>Life in a Love</i>.</p>
<p>Of the poems of attainment one&#8212;<i>Respectability</i>&#8212;has
the spirit of youth and gaiety in it. Here love makes
its gallant bid for freedom, fires up for lawlessness, if
need be, and at least sets convention at defiance:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The world's good word!&#8212;the Institute!<br />
</span><span>Guizot receives Montalembert!<br />
</span><span>Eh? Down the court three lampions flare:<br />
</span><span>Set forward your best foot!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>But, after all, this love may be no more than an
adventure of the boulevard and the attic in the manner
of B&eacute;ranger's gay Bohemianism. The distance is wide
between such &eacute;lan of youthful passion and the fidelity
which is inevitable, and on which age has set its seal,
in that poem of perfect attainment, <i>By the Fireside</i>.
This is the love which completes the individual life
and at the same time incorporates it with the life
of humanity, which unites as one the past and the
present, and which, owing no allegiance of a servile
kind to time, becomes a pledge for futurity.
Browning's personal experience is here taken up
into his imagination and transfigured, but its substance
remains what it had been in literal fact.</p>
<p>The poems of failure are more numerous, and they
range through various degrees and kinds of failure.
It is not death which can bring the sense of failure to
love. In <i>Evelyn Hope</i> all the passion has been on the
man's side; all possibilities of love in the virginal
heart of the dead girl, all her warmth and sweetness,
had been folded in the bud. But death, in the mood
of infinite tenderness and unfulfilled aspiration which
the poem expresses, seems no bar to some far-off
<a name="Page_184"></a>attainment, of which the speaker's passion,
breaking
through time, is the assurance, an attainment the
nature of which he cannot divine but which will
surely explain the meaning of things that are now
obscure. Perhaps the saddest and the most hopeless
kind of failure is that in which, to borrow an image
from the old allegory, the arrow of love all but flies to
the mark and yet just misses it. This is the subject
of a poem equally admirable in its descriptive and its
emotional passages, <i>Two in the Campagna</i>. The line
"One near one is too far," might serve as its motto.
Satisfaction is all but reached and never can be
reached. Two hearts touch and never can unite.
One drop of the salt estranging sea is as unplumbed
as the whole ocean. And the only possible end is</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Infinite passion, and the pain<br />
</span><span>Of finite hearts that yearn.<a name="FNanchor_65"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a><br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Compared with such a failure as this an offer of love
rejected, rejected with decision but not ungenerously,
may be accounted a success. There is something
tonic to a brave heart in the putting forth of will, even
though it encounter an obstacle which cannot be removed.
Such is the mood which is presented in
<i>One Way of Love</i>; the foiled lover has at least made
his supreme effort; it has been fruitless, but he thinks
with satisfaction that he has played boldly for the
prize, and never can he say that it was not worth
risking all on the bare chance of success:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>She will not give me heaven? 'Tis well!<br />
</span><span>Lose who may&#8212;I still can say<br />
</span><span>Those who win heaven, blest are they!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_185"></a>So, too, in <i>The Last Ride together</i>,
the lover is
defeated but he is not cast down, and he remains
magnanimous throughout the grief of defeat. Who
in this our life&#8212;he reflects&#8212;statesman or soldier,
sculptor or poet, attains his complete ideal? He has
been granted the grace of one hour by his mistress'
side, and he will carry the grateful recollection of
this with him into the future as his inalienable and
his best possession. With these generous rejections and
magnanimous acceptances of failure stands in contrast
<i>A Serenade at the Villa</i>, where the lover's devotion is
met only by obdurate insensibility or, worse, by an
irritated sense of the persecution and plague of such
love, and where all things seem to conspire to leave
his pain mere pain, bitter and unredeemed.</p>
<p>In these examples, though love has been frustrated
in its aim, the cause of failure did not lie in any
infirmity of the lover's heart or will. But what if the
will itself be supine, what if it dallies and delays,
consults the convenience of occasions, observes the
indications of a shallow prudence, slackens its pace
towards the goal, and meanwhile the passion languishes
and grows pale from day to day, until the day of love
has waned, and the passion dies in a twilight hour
through mere inanition? Such a failure as this seems to
Browning to mean the perishing of a soul, or of more souls
than one. He takes in <i>The Statue and the Bust</i> a case
where the fulfilment of passion would have been a crime.
The lady is a bride of the Riccardi; to win her, now a
wedded wife, would be to violate the law of God and man.
Nevertheless it is her face which has "filled the empty
sheath of a man" with a blade for a knight's adventure&#8212;The</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Duke grew straightway brave and wise.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_186"></a>And then follow delays of convenience,
excuses,
postponements, and the Duke's flood of passion
dwindles to a thread, and is lost in the sandy flats
of life:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>So weeks grew months, years; gleam by gleam<br />
</span><span>The glory dropped from their youth and love,<br />
</span><span>And both perceived they had dreamed a dream.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Their end was a crime, but Browning's contention
is that a crime may serve for a test as well as a
virtue; in that test the Duke and the lady had alike
failed through mere languor of soul:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>And the sin I impute to each frustrate ghost<br />
</span><span>Is&#8212;the unlit lamp and the ungirt loin,<br />
</span><span>Though the end in sight was a vice, I say.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Had Tennyson treated the same subject he would
probably have glorified their action as a victorious
obedience to the law of self-reverence and self-control.</p>
<p>The reunion and the severance of lovers are presented
in three poems. Winter, chill without but
warm within, with its pastimes of passion, the energies
of joy breaking forth in play, is contrasted in <i>A Lovers'
Quarrel</i> with springtime, all gladness without and a
strange void and shiver at the heart of things, because
alienation has taken the place of camaraderie between
the lover and his mistress. The mass and intensity
of colour in the stanza which dashes in a sketch of the
Pampas, with its leagues of sunflowers, and a wild
horse, "black neck and eyeballs keen" appearing
through them, almost afflict the reader's sense of sight.
There is a fine irony in the title of the other poem of
contention, <i>A Womans Last Word</i>: In a quarrel a
<a name="Page_187"></a>woman will have the last word, and here it
is&#8212;the
need of quietude for a little while that she may recover
from the bewildering stroke of pain, and then
entire oblivion of the wrong with unmeasured self-surrender.
The poem of union, <i>Love among the Ruins</i>,
is constructed in a triple contrast; the endless pastures
prolonged to the edge of sunset, with their infinity of
calm, are contrasted with the vast and magnificent
animation of the city which once occupied the plain
and the mountain slopes. The lover keeps at arm's-length
from his heart and brain what yet fills them all
the while; here in this placid pasture-land is one vivid
point of intensest life; here where once were the
grandeur and tumult of the enormous city is that
which in a moment can abolish for the lover all its
glories and its shames. His eager anticipation of
meeting his beloved, face to face and heart to heart,
is not sung, after the manner of Burns, as a jet of unmingled
joy; he delays his rapture to make its arrival
more entirely rapturous; he uses his imagination to
check and to enhance his passion; and the poem,
though not a simple cry of the heart, is entirely true
as a rendering of emotion which has taken imagination
into its service. In like manner <i>By the Fireside,
A Serenade at the Villa</i>, and <i>Two in the Campagna</i>,
include certain studies of nature and its moods, sometimes
with a curiously minute observation of details;
and these serve as the overture to some intense
moment of joy or pain, or form the orchestration
which sustains or reinforces a human voice.</p>
<p>Of the pieces relating to art those connected with
the art of poetry are the least valuable. <i>Transcendentalism</i>
sets forth the old doctrine that poetry
<a name="Page_188"></a>must be sensuous and passionate, leaving it to
philosophy
to deal with the naked abstractions of the
intellect. <i>How it strikes a Contemporary</i> shows by a
humorous example how a poet's character and private
life may be misconceived and misrepresented by those
among whom he moves. <i>Popularity</i> maintains that
the poet who is in the highest sense original, an
inventor of new things, may be wholly disregarded
for long, while his followers and imitators secure both
the porridge and the praise; one day God's hand,
which holds him, will open and let out all the beauty.
The thought is an obvious one enough, but the image
of the fisher and the murex, in which the thought is
embodied, affords opportunity for stanzas glowing with
colour. Two poems, and each of them a remarkable
poem, are interpretations of music. One, <i>Master
Hugues of Saxe-Gotha</i>, is a singularly successful
<i>tour de force</i>, if it is no more. Poetry inspired by
music is almost invariably the rendering of a sentiment
or a mood which the music is supposed to
express; but here, in dealing with the fugue of his
imaginary German composer, Browning finds his inspiration
not in the sentiment but in the structure
of the composition; he competes, as it were, in
language with the art or science of the contrapuntist,
and evolves an idea of his own from its complexity
and elaboration. The poem of Italian music, <i>A
Toccata of Galuppi's</i>, wholly subordinates the science
to the sentiment of the piece. It is steeped in the
melancholy of pleasure; Venice of the eighteenth
century lives before us with its mundane joys, its
transitory passions, its voluptuous hours; and in the
midst of its warmth and colour a chill creeps upon
<a name="Page_189"></a>our senses and we shiver. Browning's artistic
self-restraint
is admirable; he has his own truth to utter
aloud if he should please; but here he will not play
the prophet; the life of eighteenth-century Venice is
dust and ashes; the poet will say not a word more
than the musician has said in his toccata; the ruthlessness
of time and death make him a little remorseful;
it is enough, and too much, that through this
music of the hours of love and pleasure we should
hear, as it were, the fall of the clay upon a coffin-lid.</p>
<p>Shelley was more impressed by the sculpture than
the paintings of Italy. There are few evidences of
the influence of the most ideal of the arts that appeal
to the mind through the eye in Browning's poetry;
and his sympathies would be more apt to respond to
such work as Michael Angelo's, which sends the
spectator beyond itself, than to the classical work
which has the absoluteness and the calm of attained
perfection.<a name="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a>
The sensuous and the spiritual qualities
of colour were vividly felt by him; a yellowing old
marble seemed perhaps to impose itself with a cold
authority upon the imagination. But the suggestion
of two portrait busts of the period of classical decadence,
one in marble representing a boy, and the
other the powerful head of a man in granite, gave
rise to <i>Protus</i>, one of the few flawless poems of
Browning. His mastery over the rhymed couplet is
nowhere seen to greater advantage, unless it be in
a few passages of <i>Sordello</i>. The poem is, however,
more a page from history than a study in the fine arts;
and Browning's imagination has made it a page which
lives in our memory through a pathos veiled under
<a name="Page_190"></a>strong objective touches, never protruding
itself sentimentally
in quest of tenderness or pity.</p>
<p>"I spent some most delightful time," Rossetti wrote
to Allingham shortly after the publication of <i>Men and
Women</i>, "with Browning at Paris, both in the evenings
and at the Louvre, where (and throughout conversation)
I found his knowledge of early Italian art beyond
that of any one I ever met&#8212;<i>encyclopedically</i> beyond
that of Ruskin himself." The poem <i>Old Pictures at
Florence</i>, which Rossetti calls "a jolly thing," and
which is that and much more, is full of Browning's
learned enthusiasm for the early Italian painters, and
it gives a reason for the strong attraction which their
adventures after new beauty and passion had for him
as compared with the faultless achievements of classical
sculpture. Greek art, according to Browning, by presenting
unattainable ideals of material and mundane
perfection, taught men to submit. Early Christian art,
even by faultily presenting spiritual ideals, not to be
attained on earth but to be pursued through an immortal
life, taught men to aspire. The aim of these
painters was not to exhibit strength or grace, joy or
grief, rage or love in their complete earthly attainment,
but rather to</p>

<h5>ANDREA DEL SARTO.</h5>
<h5><i>From a print after the portrait by himself in the Uffizi
Gallery,
Florence</i>.</h5>
<p>The prophecy with which the poem concludes, of a
great revival of Italian art consequent on the advent
of political and intellectual liberty, has not obtained
fulfilment in the course of the half century that has
elapsed since it was uttered. Browning's doctrine that
<a name="Page_191"></a>aspiration towards what is higher is more to be
valued
in art than the attainment of what is lower is a leading
motive in the admirable dramatic monologue
placed in the lips of Andrea del Sarto, the faultless
painter. His craftsmanship is unerring; whatever he
imagines he can achieve; nothing in line or in colour is
other than it ought to be; and yet precisely because he
has succeeded, his failure is profound and irretrievable:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp,<br />
</span><span>Or what's a heaven for? All is silver-grey<br />
</span><span>Placid and perfect with my art: the worse!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>He could set right the arm which is wrongly put in
Rafael's work that fronts him; but "all the play, the
insight and the stretch" of Rafael are lacking in his
own faultless lines. He looks back regretfully to his
kingly days at Fontainebleau with the royal Francis,
when what seemed a veritable fire was in his heart.
And he tries to find an excuse for his failure as artist
and as man in the coldness of his beautiful Lucrezia&#8212;for
he who has failed in the higher art has also failed
in the higher love&#8212;Lucrezia, who values his work
only by the coins it brings in, and who needs those
coins just now for one whose whistle invites her away.
All might be so much better otherwise! Yet otherwise
he cannot choose that it should be; his art must
remain what it is&#8212;not golden but silver-grey; and
his Lucrezia may attend to the Cousin's whistle if only
she retains the charm, not to be evaded, of her beauty.<a
 name="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>
<p><a name="Page_192"></a>Browning does not mean that art in its
passionate
pursuit of the highest ends should be indifferent to
the means, or that things spiritual do not require as
adequate a sensuous embodiment as they are capable
of receiving from the painter's brush or the poet's pen.
Were art a mere symbol or suggestion, two bits of
sticks nailed crosswise might claim to be art as
admirable as any. What is the eye for, if not to see
with vivid exactness? what is the hand for, if not to
fashion things as nature made them? It is through
body that we reach after the soul; and the passion
for truth and reality is a passion for the invisible
which is expressed in and through these. Such is the
pleading of Fra Lippo Lippi, the tonsured painter
caught out of bounds, in that poem in which the
dramatic monologue of Browning attains its perfection
of life and energy. Fra Lippo is intoxicated by the
mere forms and colours of things, and he is assured
that these mean intensely and mean well:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The beauty and the wonder and the power,<br />
</span><span>The shapes of things, their colours, lights and shades,<br />
</span><span>Changes, surprises&#8212;and God made it all!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>These are the gospel to preach which he girds loin
and lights the lamp, though he may perforce indulge
a patron in shallower pieties of the conventional order,
and though it is not all gospel with him, for now and
again, when the moon shines and girls go skipping
and singing down Florence streets&#8212;"Zooks, sir, flesh
and blood, that's all I'm made of!" Fra Lippo with
his outbreaks of frank sensuality is far nearer to
Browning's kingdom of heaven than is the faultless
painter; he presses with ardour towards his proper
goal in art; he has full faith in the ideal, but with him
<a name="Page_193"></a>it is to be sought only through the real; or
rather it
need not be sought at all, for one who captures any
fragment of reality captures also undesignedly and
inevitably its divine significance.<a name="FNanchor_68"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>
<p>The same doctrine which is applied to art in <i>Old
Pictures in Florence</i>, that high aims, though unattained,
are of more worth than a lower achievement, is applied,
and with a fine lyrical enthusiasm, to the pursuit of
knowledge in <i>A Grammarian's Funeral</i>. The time is
"shortly after the Revival of Learning in Europe";
the place&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>a tall mountain, citied to the top,<br />
</span><span>Crowded with culture!&#8212;<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>is imagined to suit the idea of the poem. The dead
scholar, borne to the summit for burial on the shoulders
of his disciples, had been possessed by the aspiration
of Paracelsus&#8212;to know; and, unlike Paracelsus, he
had never sought on earth both to know and to enjoy.
He has been the saint and the martyr of Renaissance
philology. For the genius of such a writer as the
author of <i>Hudibras</i>, with his positive intellect and
dense common sense, there could hardly have been
found a fitter object for mockery than this remorseless
and indefatigable pedant. Browning, through the
singing voices of the dead master's disciples, exalts
him to an eminence of honour and splendid fame. To
a scholar Greek particles may serve as the fittest test
<a name="Page_194"></a>of virtue; this glorious pedant has postponed
life and
the enjoyments of life to future cycles of existence;
here on earth he expends a desperate passion&#8212;upon
what? Upon the dryasdust intricacies of grammar;
and it is not as though he had already attained; he
only desperately follows after:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>That low man seeks a little thing to do,<br />
</span><span>Sees it and does it:<br />
</span><span>This high man, with a great thing to pursue,<br />
</span><span>Dies ere he knows it.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>But again the grammarian, like the painter, does not
strive after a vague, transcendental ideal; he is not as
one that beateth the air; his quest for knowledge
is definite and positive enough; he throws all care
for infinite things, except the infinite of philological
accuracy, upon God; and the viaticum of his last
moments is one more point of grammar.</p>
<p>Two of the poems of <i>Men and Women</i> are pages
tragic-grotesque and pathetic-grotesque from the history
of religion. In <i>The Heretic s Tragedy</i> John, Master
of the Temple, burns alive in Paris square for his sins
against the faith and Holy Church; the glow of the
blazing larch and pine almost reaches the reader of
the stanzas; the great petals of this red rose of flame
bend towards him; the gust of sulphur offends his
nostrils. And the rage of piety is hotter than the
fire; it is a mingled passion, compounded of delight
in the fierce spectacle, a thrilling ecstacy at the sight
of a fellow-creature tortured, the self-complacency of
conscious orthodoxy, and the horrible zeal of the
Lord's house. Yet though the event is sung by one
of the rejoicing orthodox, somehow we are made to
feel that when John the apostate, bound in the flames
<a name="Page_195"></a>and gagged, prays to Jesus Christ to save him,
that
prayer may have been answered. This passage from
the story of the age of faith was not selected with a
view to please the mediaeval revivalists of the nineteenth
century, but in truth its chief value is not
theological or historical but artistic. <i>Holy Cross Day</i>,
a second fragment from history, does not fall from the
sublime to the ridiculous but rises from the ridiculous
to the sublime. The picture of the close-packed Jews
tumbling or sidling churchwards to hear the Christian
sermon (for He saith "Compel them to come in") and
to partake of heavenly grace has in it something of
Rembrandt united with something of Callot. Such a
crew of devout impostors is at once comic and piteous.
But while they are cared for in the merciful bowels of
the Church, and groan out the expected compunction,
their ancient piety is not extinct; their hearts burn
in them with the memory of Jacob's House and of
Jerusalem. Christ at least was of their kindred, and
if they wronged Him in past time, they will not wrong
Him now by naming these who outrage and insult
them after His name.</p>
<p>The historical distortions of the religion of Christ
do not, however, disturb the faith of Browning in the
Christian revelation of Divine love. In <i>Cleon</i> he exhibits
the failure of Paganism, even in its forms of
highest culture, to solve the riddle of life and to answer
the requirements of the human spirit. All that regal
power liberally and wisely used can confer belongs to
Protus in his Tyranny; all that genius, and learning
and art can confer is the possession of Cleon; and a
profound discouragement has settled down upon the
soul of each. The race progresses from point to point;
<a name="Page_196"></a>self-consciousness is deepened and quickened as
generation succeeds generation; the sympathies of
the individual are multiplied and extended. But he
that increases knowledge, increases sorrow; most progress
is most failure; the soul climbs the heights only
to perish there. Every day the sense of joy grows
more acute; every day the soul grows more enlarged;
and every day the power to put our best
attainments to use diminishes. "And how dieth
the wise man? As the fool. Therefore I hated life;
yea, I hated all my labour that I had taken under the
sun." The poem is, indeed, an Ecclesiastes of pagan
religion. The assurance of extinction is the worm
which gnaws at the heart of the rose:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>It is so horrible<br />
</span><span>I dare at times imagine to my need<br />
</span><span>Some future state revealed to us by Zeus,<br />
</span><span>Unlimited in capability<br />
</span><span>For joy, as this is in desire for joy.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>But this is no better than a dream; Zeus could not
but have revealed it, were it possible. Browning does
not bring his Cleon, as Pater brings his Marius, into
the Christian catacombs, where the image of the
Shepherd bearing his lamb might interpret the mystery
of death, nor to that house of Cecilia where Marius
sees a new joy illuminating every face. Cleon has
heard of Paulus and of Christus, but who can suppose
that a mere barbarian Jew</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Hath access to a secret shut from us?<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The doctrine of Christ, preached on the island by
certain slaves, is reported by an intelligent listener to
be one which no sane man can accept. And Cleon
<a name="Page_197"></a>will not squander the time that might be well
employed
in studying the proportions of a man or in combining
the moods of music&#8212;the later hours of a philosopher
and a poet&#8212;on the futile creed of slaves.</p>
<p>Immortality and Divine love&#8212;these were the great
words pronounced by Paul and by Christ. <i>Cleon</i> is the
despairing cry of Pagan culture for the life beyond
the grave which would attune to harmony the dissonances
of earth, and render intelligible its mournful
obscurities. <i>Saul</i>, in the completed form of 1855, and
<i>An Epistle of Karshish</i> are, the one a prophecy, the
other a divination, of the mystery of the love of God
in the life and death of his Son. The culminating
moment in the effort of David by which he rouses to
life the sunken soul of the King, the moment towards
which all others tend, is that in which he finds in his
own nature love as God's ultimate gift, and assured
that in this, as in other gifts, the creature cannot
surpass the Creator, he breaks forth into a prophecy
of God's love made perfect in weakness:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>O Saul, it shall be<br />
</span><span>A Face like my face that receives thee; a Man like to me<br />
</span><span>Thou shalt love and be loved by, for ever: a Hand like
this hand<br />
</span><span>Shall throw open the gates of new life to thee! See the
Christ stand!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>What follows in the poem is only the awe, the
solemnity of this discovery which has come not through
any processes of reasoning but by a passionate interpretation
of the enthusiasm of love and self-sacrifice
in David's own heart; only this awe, and the seeming
extension of his throbbing emotion and pent knowledge
over the face of external nature, until night passes and
with the dawn earth and heaven resume their wonted
ways. The case of Lazarus as studied by Karshish
<a name="Page_198"></a>the Arabian physician results not in a rapturous
prophecy
like that of David, but in a stupendous conjecture
of the heart which all the scepticism of the
brain of a man of science cannot banish or reduce to
insignificance. The unaccountable fascination of this
case of mania, subinduced by epilepsy, is not to be
resisted; Karshish would write, if he could, of more
important matters than the madman of Bethany; he
would record his discoveries in scalp-disease, describe
the peculiar qualities of Judea's gum-tragacanth, and
disclose the secret of those virtues derived from the
mottled spiders of the tombs. But the face of Lazarus,
patient or joyous, the strange remoteness in his gaze,
his singular valuations of objects and events, his great
ardour, his great calm, his possession of some secret
which gives new meanings to all things, the perfect
logic of his irrationality, his unexampled gentleness
and love&#8212;these are memories which the keen-sighted
Arabian physician is unable to put by, so curious, so
attaching a potency lies in the person of this man who
holds that he was dead and rose again, Karshish has
a certain sense of shame that he, a man learned in all
the wisdom of his day, should be so deeply moved.
And yet how the thought of the secret possessed by
this Judean maniac&#8212;it is the secret of Jesus&#8212;fills
and expands the soul!</p>

</div>
<p><a name="Page_199"></a>Science has at least something to consider in
a
thought so strangely potent.</p>
<p>A nineteenth-century sceptic's exposition of his
Christian faith is the paradoxical subject of <i>Bishop
Blougram's Apology</i>, and it is one which admirably
suited that side of Browning's genius which leaned
towards intellectual casuistry. But the poem is not
only skilful casuistry&#8212;and casuistry, let it be remembered,
is not properly the art of defending falsehood
but of determining truth,&#8212;it is also a character-study
chosen from the age of doubt; a dramatic monologue
with an appropriate <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i>; a display of fence
and thrust which as a piece of art and wit rewards an
intelligent spectator. That Cardinal Wiseman sat for
the Bishop's portrait is a matter of little consequence;
the merit of the study is independent of any connection
with an individual; it answers delightfully the cynical&#8212;yet
not wholly cynical&#8212;question: How, for our
gain in both worlds, can we best economise our scepticism
and make a little belief go far?<a name="FNanchor_69"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> The nineteenth
century is not precisely the age of the martyrs, or, if
we are to find them, we must in general turn to politics
and to science; Bishop Blougram does not pique
himself on a genius for martyrdom; if he fights with
beasts, it is on this occasion with a very small one,
a lynx of the literary tribe, and in the arena of his
own dining-room over the after-dinner wine. He is
pre-eminently a man of his time, when the cross and
its doctrine can be comfortably borne; both he and
his table-companion, honoured for this one occasion
only with the episcopal invitation, appreciate the good
<a name="Page_200"></a>things of this world, but the Bishop has a vast
advantage
over the maker of "lively lightsome articles"
for the reviews, and he uses his advantage, it must be
confessed, to the full. We are in company with no
petty man while we read the poem and hear the great
Bishop roll out, with easy affluence, his long crumpled
mind. He is delightfully frank and delightfully
subtle; concealing himself by self-disclosure; opulent
in ideas; shifting the pea of truth dexterously under
the three gilded thimbles; blandly condescending and
amiably contemptuous; a little feline, for he allows
his adversary a moment's freedom to escape and then
pounces upon him with the soft-furred claws; assured
of his superiority in the game, yet using only half his
mind; fencing with one arm pinioned; chess-playing
with a rook and pawn given to his antagonist; or
shall we say chess-playing blindfold and seeing every
piece upon the board? Is <i>Bishop Blougram's Apology</i>
a poem at all? some literary critics may ask. And
the answer is that through it we make acquaintance
with one of Browning's most genial inventions&#8212;the
great Bishop himself, and that if Gigadibs were not
present we could never have seen him at the particular
angle at which he presents himself in his condescending
play with truths and half-truths and quarter-truths,
adapted to a smaller mind than his own. The sixteenth
century gave us a Montaigne, and the seventeenth
century a Pascal. Why should not the nineteenth
century of mundane comforts, of doubt troubled
by faith, and faith troubled by doubt, produce a new
type&#8212;serious yet humorous&#8212;in an episcopal Pascal-Montaigne?</p>
<p>Browning's moral sympathies, we may rest assured,
<a name="Page_201"></a>do not go with one who like Blougram finds
satisfaction
in things realised on earth; one who declines&#8212;at
least as he represents himself for the purposes of
argument&#8212;to press forward to things which he cannot
attain but might nobly follow after. But Browning's
intellectual interest is great in seeing all that a Blougram
can say for himself; and as a destructive piece
of criticism directed against the position of a Gigadibs
what he says may really be effective. The Bishop
frankly admits that the unqualified believer, the enthusiast,
is more fortunate than he; he, Sylvester
Blougram, is what he is, and all that he can do is to
make the most of the nature allotted to him. That
there has been a divine revelation he cannot absolutely
believe; but neither can he absolutely disbelieve.
Unbelief is sterile; belief is fruitful, certainly for this
world, probably for the next, and he elects to believe.
Having chosen to believe, he cannot be too pronounced
and decisive in his faith; he will never attempt to
eliminate certain articles of the <i>credenda</i>, and so
"decrassify" his faith, for to this process, if once begun,
there is no end; having donned his uniform, he
will wear it, laces and spangles and all. True, he has
at times his chill fits of doubt; but is not this the
probation of faith? Does not a life evince the ultimate
reality that is within us? Are not acts the evidence
of a final choice, of a deepest conviction? And
has he not given his vote for the Christian religion?</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>With me faith means perpetual unbelief<br />
</span><span>Kept quiet like the snake 'neath Michael's foot,<br />
</span><span>Who stands calm just because he feels it writhe.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>When the time arrives for a beatific vision Blougram
will be ready to adapt himself to the new state of
<a name="Page_202"></a>things. Is not the best pledge of his capacity
for
future adaptation to a new environment this&#8212;that
being in the world he is worldly? We must not
lose the training of each successive stage of evolution
by for ever projecting ourselves half way into the
next. So rolls on the argument to its triumphant
conclusion&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Fool or knave?<br />
</span><span>Why needs a bishop be a fool or knave<br />
</span><span>When there's a thousand diamond weights between?<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Only at the last, were it not that we know that
there is a firmer ground for Blougram than this on
which he takes his stand in after-dinner controversy,
we might be inclined to close the subject by adapting
to its uses the title of a pamphlet connected with the
Kingsley and Newman debate&#8212;"But was not Mr
Gigadibs right after all?" Worsted in sword-play he
certainly was; but the soul may have its say, and the
soul, armed with its instincts of truth, is a formidable
challenger.</p>

<h2>Close of Mrs Browning's Life</h2>
<br />
<p>When <i>Men and Women</i> was published in the autumn
of 1855 the Brownings were again in Paris. An impulsive
friend had taken an apartment for them in the
Rue de Grenelle, facing east, and in all that concerned
comfort splendidly mendacious. After some weeks
of misery and illness Mrs Browning was conveyed to
less glittering but more hospitable rooms in the Rue
du Colis&eacute;e by a desperate husband&#8212;"That darling
Robert carried me into the carriage, swathed past
possible breathing, over face and respirator in woollen
shawls. No, he wouldn't set me down even to walk
up the fiacre steps, but shoved me in upside down in
a struggling bundle."<a name="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a>
Happily the winter was of a
miraculous mildness. Mrs Browning worked <i>Aurora
Leigh</i> in "a sort of <i>furia</i>," and Browning set himself
to the task&#8212;a fruitless one as it proved&#8212;of rehandling
and revising <i>Sordello</i>: "I lately gave time and pains,"
he afterwards told Milsand in his published dedication
of the poem, "to turn my work into what the many
might,&#8212;instead of what the few must&#8212;like: but after
all I imagined another thing at first, and therefore leave
as I find it"&#8212;proud but warrantable words. Some
of his leisure was given to vigorous and not unsuccessful
efforts in drawing. At the theatre he saw Ristori
<a name="Page_204"></a>as Medea and admired her, but with
qualifications.
At Monckton Milnes's dinner-table he met Mignet and
Cavour, and George Sand crowned with an ivy-wreath
and "looking like herself." Mrs Browning records
with pleasure that her husband's hostility to the
French government had waned; at least he admitted
that he was sick of the Opposition.</p>
<p>In May 1856 tidings from London of the illness of
Kenyon caused him serious anxiety; he would gladly
have hastened to attend upon so true and dear a friend,
but this Kenyon would not permit. A month later he
and Mrs Browning were in occupation of Kenyon's
house in Devonshire Place, which he had lent to them
for the summer, but the invalid had sought for restoration
of his health in the Isle of Wight. On the day
that Mr Barrett heard of his daughter's arrival he
ordered his family away from London. Mrs Browning
once more wrote to him, but the letter received no
answer. "Mama," said little Pen earnestly, "if you've
been very, very naughty I advise you to go into the
room and say,'<i>Papa, I'll be dood</i>.'" But the situation,
as Mrs Browning sadly confesses, was hopeless. Some
companionship with her sister Arabel and her brothers
was gained by a swift departure from London in
August for Ventnor whither the Wimpole Street household,
leaving its master behind, had been banished,
and there "a happy sorrowful two weeks" were spent.
At Cowes a grief awaited Browning and his wife, for
they found Kenyon kind as ever but grievously broken
in health and depressed in spirits. A short visit to
Mrs Browning's married sister at Taunton closed the
summer and autumn in England. Before the end of
October they were on their way to Florence. "The
<a name="Page_205"></a>Brownings are long gone back now," wrote Dante
Rossetti in December, "and with them one of my
delights&#8212;an evening resort where I never felt unhappy.
How large a part of the real world, I wonder, are those
two small people?&#8212;taking meanwhile so little room
in any railway carriage and hardly needing a double
bed at the inn."</p>
<p>The great event of the autumn for the Brownings
and for the lovers of English poetry was the publication
of <i>Aurora Leigh</i>. Its popularity was instantaneous;
within a fortnight a second edition was called
for; there was no time to alter even a comma. "That
golden-hearted Robert," writes Mrs Browning, "is in
ecstasies about it&#8212;far more than if it all related to a
book of his own." The volume was dedicated to John
Kenyon; but before the year was at an end Kenyon
was dead. Since the birth of their son he had enlarged
the somewhat slender incomings of his friends by the
annual gift of one hundred pounds, "in order," says the
editor of Mrs Browning's Letters, "that they might be
more free to follow their art for its own sake only."
By his will he placed them for the future above all
possibility of straitened means. To Browning he left
6,500 <i>l</i>., to Mrs Browning 4,500 <i>l</i>. "These," adds
Mr F.G. Kenyon, "were the largest legacies in a very
generous will&#8212;the fitting end to a life passed in acts
of generosity and kindness to those in need." The
gain to the Brownings was shadowed by a sense of
loss. "Christmas came," says Mrs Browning, "like a
cloud." For the length of three winter months she did
not stir out of doors. Then arrived spring and sunshine,
carnival time and universal madness in Florence,
with streets "one gigantic pantomime." Penini begged
<a name="Page_206"></a>importunately for a domino, and could not be
refused;
and Penini's father and mother were for once drawn
into the vortex of Italian gaiety. When at the great
opera ball a little figure in mask and domino was
struck on the shoulder with the salutation "Bella
mascherina!" it was Mrs Browning who received the
stroke, with her husband, also in domino, by her side.
The absence of real coarseness in the midst of so
much seeming license, and the perfect social equality
gave her a gratifying impression of her Florentines.</p>
<p>In April it was summer weather; the drives of
former days in the Cascine and to Bellosguardo, where
a warm-hearted friend, Miss Isa Blagden, occupied a
villa, were resumed. An American authoress of wider
fame since her book of 1852 than even the authoress
of <i>Aurora Leigh</i>, Mrs Beecher Stowe, was in Florence,
and somewhat to their surprise she charmed both
Browning and his wife by her simplicity and earnestness,
her gentle voice and refinement of manner&#8212;"never,"
says Mrs Browning, "did lioness roar more
softly." All pointed to renewed happiness; but
before April was over pain of a kind that had a
peculiar sting left Mrs Browning for a time incapable
of any other feeling. Her father was dead, and no
word of affection had been uttered at the last; if there
was water in the rock it never welled forth. The kindly
meant effort of a relative to reopen friendly communications
between Mr Barrett and his daughters, not many
months previously, had for its only result the declaration
that they had disgraced the family.<a name="FNanchor_71"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> At first
Mrs Browning was crushed and could shed no tear;
she remained for many days in a state of miserable
<a name="Page_207"></a>prostration; it was two months before she could
write
a letter to anyone outside the circle of her nearest
kinsfolk.</p>
<p>Once more the July heat in Florence&#8212;"a composition
of Gehenna and Paradise"&#8212;drove the
Brownings to the Baths of Lucca. Miss Blagden
followed them, and also young Lytton came, ailing, it
was thought, from exposure to the sun. His indisposition
soon grew serious and declared itself as a gastric
fever. For eight nights Isa Blagden sat by his bedside
as nurse; for eight other nights Browning took her
place. His own health remained vigorous. Each
morning he bathed in a rapid mountain stream; each
evening and morning he rode a mountain pony; and
in due time he had the happiness of seeing the patient,
although still weak and hollow cheeked, convalescent
and beginning to think of "poems and apple puddings,"
as Mrs Browning declares, "in a manner other
than celestial." It had been a summer, she said in
September, full of blots, vexations, anxieties. Three
days after these words were written a new and grave
anxiety troubled her and her husband, for their son,
who had been looking like a rose&#8212;"like a rose
possessed by a fairy" is his mother's description&#8212;was
attacked in the same way as Lytton. "Don't be unhappy
for <i>me</i>" said Pen; "think it's a poor little boy
in the street, and be just only a little sorry, and not
unhappy at all." Within less than a fortnight he was
well enough to have "agonising visions of beefsteak pies
and buttered toast seen in <i>mirage</i>"; but his mother
mourned for the rosy cheeks and round fat little
shoulders, and confessed that she herself was worn
out in body and soul.</p>
<p><a name="Page_208"></a>The winter at Florence was the coldest for
many
years; the edges of the Arno were frozen; and in the
spring of 1858 Mrs Browning felt that her powers
of resistance, weakened by a year of troubles and
anxieties, had fallen low. Browning himself was in
vigorous health. When he called in June on Hawthorne
he looked younger and even handsomer than
he had looked two years previously, and his gray hairs
seemed fewer. "He talked," Hawthorne goes on, "a
wonderful quantity in a little time." That evening the
Hawthornes spent at Casa Guidi. Mrs Browning is
described by the American novelist as if she were one
of the singular creatures of his own imagination&#8212;no
earthly woman but one of the elfin race, yet sweetly
disposed towards human beings; a wonder of charm
in littleness; with a shrill yet sweet tenuity of voice;
"there is not such another figure in the world; and
her black ringlets cluster into her neck, and make her
face look whiter by their sable perfection." Browning
himself was "very efficient in keeping up conversation
with everybody, and seemed to be in all parts of the
room and in every group at the same moment; a
most vivid and quick-thoughted person&#8212;logical and
common-sensible, as, I presume, poets generally are
in their daily talk." "His conversation," says Hawthorne,
speaking of a visit to Miss Blagden at Bellosguardo,
"has the effervescent aroma which you cannot
catch even if you get the very words that seem to be
imbued with it.... His nonsense is of very genuine
and excellent quality, the true babble and effervescence
of a bright and powerful mind; and he lets it play
among his friends with the faith and simplicity of a
child."</p>
<p><a name="Page_209"></a>When summer came it was decided to join
Browning's father and sister in Paris, and accompany
them to some French seaside resort, where Mrs
Browning could have the benefit of a course of warm
salt-water baths. To her the sea was a terror, but
railway-travelling was repose, and Browning suggested
on the way from Marseilles to Paris that they might
"ride, ride together, for ever ride" during the remainder
of their lives in a first-class carriage with for-ever
renewed supplies of French novels and <i>Galignanis</i>.
They reached Paris on the elder Mr Browning's birthday,
and found him radiant at the meeting with his
son and grandson, looking, indeed, ten years younger
than when they had last seen his face. Paris, Mrs
Browning declares, was her "weakness," Italy her
"passion"; Florence itself was her "chimney-corner,"
where she "could sulk and be happy." The life of
the brilliant city, which "murmurs so of the fountain
of intellectual youth for ever and ever," quickened her
heart-beats; its new architectural splendours told of
the magnificence in design and in its accomplishment
of her hero the Emperor. And here she and her
husband met their helpful friend of former days,
Father Prout, and they were both grieved and cheered
by the sight of Lady Elgin, a paralytic, in her garden-chair,
not able to articulate a word, but bright and
gracious as ever, "the eloquent soul full and radiant,
alive to both worlds." The happiness in presence of
such a victory of the spirit was greater than the
pain.</p>
<p>Having failed to find agreeable quarters at Etretat,
where Browning in a "fine phrenzy" had hired a
wholly unsuitable house with a potato-patch for view,
<a name="Page_210"></a>and escaped from his bad bargain, a loser of
some
francs, at his wife's entreaty, they settled for a short
time at Havre&#8212;"detestable place," Mrs Browning
calls it&#8212;in a house close to the sea and surrounded
by a garden. On a bench by the shore Mrs Browning
could sit and win back a little strength in the bright
August air. The stay at Havre, depressing to
Browning's spirits, was for some eight weeks. In
October they were again in Paris, where Mrs
Browning's sister, Arabel, was their companion. The
year was far advanced and a visit to England was
not in contemplation. Towards the middle of the
month they were once more in motion, journeying by
slow stages to Florence. A day was spent at Chamb&eacute;ry
"for the sake of les Charmettes and Rousseau."
When Casa Guidi was at length reached, it was only
a halting-place on the way to Rome. Winter had
suddenly rushed in and buried all Italy in snow; but
when they started for Rome in a carriage kindly lent
by their American friends, the Eckleys, it was again
like summer. The adventures of the way were chiefly
of a negative kind&#8212;occasioned by precipices over which
they were not thrown, and banditti who never came
in sight; but in a quarrel between oxen-drivers, one
of whom attacked the other with a knife, Browning
with characteristic energy dashed between them to
the terror of the rest of the party; his garments were
the only serious sufferers from his zeal as mediator.</p>
<p>The apartment engaged at Rome was that of the
earlier visit of 1853-54, in the Via Bocca di Leone,
"rooms swimming all day in sunshine." On Christmas
morning Mrs Browning was able to accompany her
husband to St Peter's to hear the silver trumpets.
<a name="Page_211"></a>But January froze the fountains, and the north
wind
blew with force. Mrs Browning had just completed
a careful revision <i>of Aurora Leigh</i>, and now she could
rest, enjoy the sunshine streaming through their six
windows, or give herself up to the excitement of
Italian politics as seen through the newspapers in
the opening of a most eventful year. "Robert and
I," she wrote on the eve of the declaration of war
between Austria and Victor Emmanuel, "have been
of one mind lately on these things, which comforts
me much." She had also the satisfaction of health
enjoyed at least by proxy, for her husband had never
been more full of vigour and the spirit of enjoyment.
In the freezing days of January he was out of his bed
at six o'clock, and away for a brisk morning walk with
Mr Eckley. The loaf at breakfast diminished "by
Gargantuan slices." Into the social life of Rome he
threw himself with ardour. For a fortnight immediately
after Christmas he was out every night,
sometimes with double and treble engagements. "Dissipations,"
says Mrs Browning, "decidedly agree with
Robert, there's no denying that, though he's horribly
hypocritical, and 'prefers an evening with me at
home.'" He gathered various coloured fragments of
life from the outer world and brought them home to
brighten her hours of imprisonment.</p>
<p>When they returned to Florence in May the Grand
Duke had withdrawn, the city was occupied by French
troops, and there was unusual animation in the streets.
Browning shared to some extent in his wife's alienation
from the policy of England, and believed, but
with less than her enthusiastic confidence, in the good
intentions towards Italy of the French Emperor. He
<a name="Page_212"></a>subscribed his ten scudi a month to the Italian
war-fund,
and rewarded Pen for diligence in his lessons
with half a paul a day, which the boy might give as
his own contribution to the cause of Italian independence.
The French and the Italian tricolour flags,
displayed by Pen, adorned the terrace. In June the
sun beat upon Florence with unusual fierceness, but
it was a month of battles, and with bulletins of the
war arriving twice a day they could not bear to
remove to any quiet retreat at a distance from the
centre. It was not curiosity that detained them but
the passion for Italy, the joy in generous effort and
great deeds. In the rebound, as Mrs Browning
expresses it, from high-strung hopes and fears for
Italy they found themselves drawn to the theatre,
where Salvini gave his wonderful impersonation of
Othello and his Hamlet, "very great in both, Robert
thought," so commented Mrs Browning, "as well
as I."<a name="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a>
The strain of excitement was indeed excessive
for Mrs Browning's failing physical strength;
there was in it something almost febrile. Yet the
fact is noteworthy that the romantic figures secured
much less of her interest than the men of prudent
statesmanship. She esteemed Cavour highly; she
wholly distrusted Mazzini. She justified Louis
Napoleon in concessions which she regarded as an
<a name="Page_213"></a>unavoidable part of diplomacy directed to ends
which
could not be immediately attained. Garibaldi was
a "hero," but somewhat alarming in his heroisms&#8212;a
"grand child," "not a man of much brain." After the
victories of Magenta and Solferino came what seemed
to many the great betrayal of Villafranca. For a
day the busts and portraits of the French Emperor
suddenly disappeared from the shop-windows of
Florence, and even Mrs Browning would not let her
boy wear his Napoleon medal. But the busts returned
to their places, and Mrs Browning's faith in
Napoleon sprang up anew; it was not he who was
the criminal; the selfish powers of Europe had "forced
his hand" and "truncated his great intentions." She
rejoiced in the magnificent spectacle of dignity and
calm presented by the people of Italy. And yet her
fall from the clouds to earth on the announcement
of peace with Austria was a shattering experience.
Sleep left her, or if she slept her dreams were affected
by "inscrutable articles of peace and endless provisional
governments." Night after night her husband
watched beside her, and in the day he not only gave
his boy the accustomed two hours' lesson on the
piano, but replaced the boy's mother as teacher of
those miscellaneous lessons, which had been her
educational province. "Robert has been perfect to
me," expressed Mrs Browning's feelings in a word.</p>
<p>Another anxiety gave Browning an opportunity
which he turned to account in a way that renders
honour and gratitude his due from all lovers of
English letters. At a great old age Landor, who
resided with his family at Fiesole, still retained his
violent and intractable temper; in his home there
<a name="Page_214"></a>was much to excite his leonine wrath and sense
of
intolerable wrong. Three times he had quitted his
villa, with vows never to return to it, and three times
he had been led back. When for a fourth time&#8212;like
a feeble yet majestic Lear&#8212;one hot summer day,
toward noon, he flung himself, or was flung, out of
doors with only a few pauls in his pocket, it was to
Casa Guidi that he made his way broken-hearted, yet
breathing forth wrath.<a name="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a>
Browning had often said, as
his wife tells her sister-in-law, that he owed more as
a writer to Landor than to any other contemporary.<a name="FNanchor_74"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a>
He resolved to set things right, if possible; and if
not, to make the best of a case that could not be
entirely amended. A visit to the villa assured him
that reconciliation was out of the question. He provided
for Landor's immediate wants; communicated
with Landor's brothers in England, who were prompt
in arranging for a regular allowance to be administered
by Browning; became the old man's guide
and guardian; soothed his wounded spirit, although,
according to Mrs Browning, not often happy when
he attempted compliments, with generous words and
ready quotations from Landor's own writings; and
finally settled him in Florence under the care of Mrs
Browning's faithful maid Wilson, who watched over
him during the remainder of his life.<a name="FNanchor_75"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> To his incredulous
wife Browning spoke of Landor's sweetness
<a name="Page_215"></a>and gentleness, nor was he wrong in ascribing
these
qualities to the old lion. She admitted that he had
generous impulses, but feared that her husband would
before long become, like other friends of Landor, the
object of some enraged suspicion. "Nothing coheres
in him," she writes, "either in his opinions, or, I fear,
affections." But Landor, whose courtesy and refinement
she acknowledges, had also a heart that was
capable of loyal love and gratitude. After the first
burst of rage against the Fiesole household had spent
itself, he beguiled the time in perpetuating his indignations
in an innocent and classical form&#8212;that
of Latin alcaics directed against one private and
one public foe&#8212;his wife and the Emperor Louis
Napoleon.<a name="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>
<p>Lander's affairs threatened to detain the Brownings
in Florence longer than they desired, now that peace
had come and it was not indispensable to run out of
doors twice a day in order to inspect the bulletins.
But after three weeks of very exhausting illness, Mrs
Browning needed change of air. As soon as her
strength allowed, she was lifted into a carriage and
they journeyed, as in the year 1850, to the neighbourhood
of Siena. She reached the villa which had
been engaged by Story's aid, with the sense of "a
peculiar frailty of being." Though confined to the
house, the fresher air by day and the night winds
gradually revived her strength and spirits. The
silence and repose were "heavenly things" to her:
the "pretty dimpled ground covered by low vine<a name="Page_216"></a>yards"
rested her eyes and her mind; and for
excitements, instead of reports of battle-fields there
were slow-fading scarlet sunsets over purple hills.
A kind Prussian physician, Gresonowsky, who had
attended Mrs Browning in Florence, and who entered
sympathetically into her political feelings, followed
her uninvited to Siena and gave her the benefit of
his care, declining all recompense. The good friends
from America, the Storys, were not far off, and Landor,
after a visit to Story, was placed in occupation of
rooms not a stone's-cast from their villa. With Pen it
was a time of rejoicing, for his father had bought the
boy a Sardinian pony of the colour of his curls, and
he was to be seen galloping through the lanes "like
Puck," to use Browning's comparison, on a dragon-fly's
back.<a name="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>
<p>The gipsy instinct, the desire of wandering, had
greatly declined with both husband and wife since the
earlier days in Italy. Yet when they returned to Casa
Guidi it was only for six weeks. Even at the close of
the visit to Siena Mrs Browning had recovered but a
slender modicum of strength; she did not dare to
enter the cathedral, for there were steps to climb.
At Florence she felt her old vitality return and her
spirits rose. But the climate of Rome was considered
by Dr Gresonowsky more suitable for winter, and
towards the close of November they took their departure,
flying from the Florentine tramontana. The
carriage was furnished with novels of Balzac, and
Pen's pony was of the party. The rooms taken in
the Via del Tritone were bright and sunny; but a
<a name="Page_217"></a>rash visit to the jeweller Castellani, to see
and touch
the swords presented by Roman citizens to Napoleon
III. and Victor Emmanuel, threw back Mrs Browning
into all her former troubles of a delicate chest and
left her "as weak as a rag." Tidings of the death of
Lady Elgin seemed to tell only of a peaceful release
from a period of imprisonment in the body, but the
loss of Mrs Jameson was a painful blow. Rome at a
time of grave political apprehensions was almost empty
of foreigners; but among the few Americans who
had courage to stay were the sculptor Gibson and
Theodore Parker&#8212;now near the close of his life&#8212;whose
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i> were eloquent of beliefs and
disbeliefs.
As the spring advanced the authoress of
"The Mill on the Floss" was reported to be now and
again visible in Rome, "with her elective affinity," as
Mrs Browning puts it, "on the Corso walking, or in
the Vatican musing. Always together." A grand-daughter
of Lord Byron&#8212;"very quiet and very
intense"&#8212;was among the visitors at the Via del
Tritone, and Lady Marion Alford, "very eager about
literature and art and Robert," for all which eagernesses
Mrs Browning felt bound to care for her. The artists
Burne-Jones and Prinsep had made Browning's acquaintance
at Siena; Prinsep now introduced him to
some of the by-ways of popular life in Rome. Together
they witnessed the rivalry of two improvisatori
poetic gamecocks, whose efforts were stimulated by the
announcement that a great poet from England was
present; together they listened to the forbidden
Hymn to Garibaldi played in Gigi's <i>osteria</i>, witnessed
the dignified blindness of the Papal gendarmes to the
offence, while Gigi liberally plied them with drink;
<a name="Page_218"></a>and together, to relieve the host of all fear of
more
revolutionary airs, they took carriages with their
musicians and drove to see the Coliseum by moonlight.<a
 name="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>
<p>The project of a joint volume of poems on the
Italian question by Browning and his wife, which had
made considerable progress towards realisation, had
been dropped after Villafranca, when Browning destroyed
his poem; but Mrs Browning had advanced
alone and was now revising proofs of her slender
contribution to the poetry of politics, <i>Poems before
Congress.</i> She wrote them, she says, simply to deliver
her soul&#8212;"to get the relief to my conscience and
heart, which comes from a pent-up word spoken or
a tear shed." She can hardly have anticipated that
they would be popular in England; but she was not
prepared for one poem which denounced American
slavery being misinterpreted into a curse pronounced
upon England. "Robert was <i>furious</i>" against the
offending Review, she says; "I never saw him so
enraged about a criticism;" but by-and-by he "didn't
care a straw." His wife, on the other hand, was more
deeply pained by the blindness and deafness of the
British public towards her husband's genius; nobody
"except a small knot of pre-Rafaelite men" did him
justice; his publisher's returns were a proof of this not
to be gainsaid&#8212;not one copy of his poems had for six
months been sold, while in America he was already a
power. For the poetry of political enthusiasm he had
certainly no vocation. When Savoy was surrendered
to France Mrs Browning suffered some pain lest
her Emperor's generosity might seem compromised.
<a name="Page_219"></a>Browning admitted that the liberation of Italy
was
a great action, adding cynically of his future Prince
Hohenstiel-Schwangau, "But he has taken eighteen-pence
for it, which is a pity." During the winter
he wrote much. "Robert deserves no reproaches,"
his wife tells her friend Miss Haworth in May, "for
he has been writing a good deal this winter&#8212;working
at a long poem, which I have not seen a line of, and
producing short lyrics which I have seen, and may
declare worthy of him." Mr F.G. Kenyon conjectures
that the long poem is not unlikely to have
been <i>Mr Sludge the Medium</i>, for Home's performances,
as he says, were at this time rampant.<a name="FNanchor_79"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> As hitherto,
both husband and wife showed their poems each to
the other only when the poems were complete; thus
like a pair of hardy friends they maintained their
independence. Even when they read, there was no
reading aloud; Mrs Browning was indefatigable in
her passion for books; her husband, with muscular
energy impatient for action, found it impossible to
read for long at a single sitting.</p>
<p>On June 4th 1860 they left Rome, travelling by
vettura through Orvieto and Chiusi to their home in
Florence.<a name="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a>
The journey fatigued Mrs Browning, but
on arriving they had the happiness of finding Landor
well; he looked not less than magnificent, displaying
"the most beautiful sea-foam of a beard ... all in a
curl and white bubblement of beauty." Wilson had
the old man under happy control; only once had he
<a name="Page_220"></a>thrown his dinner out of the window; that he
should
be at odds with all the world was inevitable, and that
all the world should be in the wrong was exhilarating
and restorative. The plans for the summer were
identical with those of the preceding year; the same
"great lonely villa" near Siena was occupied again;
the same "deep soothing silence" lapped to rest Mrs
Browning's spirits; Landor, her "adopted son"&#8212;a son
of eighty-six years old&#8212;was hard by as he had been
last summer. The neighbourhood of Miss Blagden
was this year an added pleasure. "The little eager
lady," as Henry James describes her, "with gentle,
gay black eyes," had seen much, read much, written
already a little (with more to follow), but better than
all else were her generous heart and her helpful hand.
The season was one of unusual coolness for Italy.
Pen's pony, as before, flashed through the lanes and
along the roads. Browning had returned from Rome
in robust health, and looking stouter in person than
six months previously. Now, while a tenant of the
Villa Alberti, he spent his energies in long rides,
sometimes rides of three or four continuous hours.
On returning from such careers on horseback little
inclination, although he had his solitary room in which
to work, remained for the pursuit of poetry.</p>
<p>The departure for Rome was early&#8212;about
September; in the Via Felice rooms were found.
A new and great sorrow had fallen upon Mrs
Browning&#8212;her sister Henrietta, Mrs Surtees Cook,
was dead, leaving behind her three young children.
Mrs Browning could not shed tears nor speak of
her grief: she felt tired and beaten by the pain; and
tried to persuade herself that for one who believed
<a name="Page_221"></a>the invisible world to be so near, such pain was
but
a weakness. Her husband was able to do little, but
he shared in his degree in the sense of loss, and protected
her from the intrusion of untimely visitors.
Sir John Bowring was admitted because he presented
a letter of introduction and had intimate relations
with the French Emperor; his ridicule of the volunteer
movement in England, with its cry of "Riflemen,
form!" was grateful to Mrs Browning's political feelings.
French troops were now in Rome; their purpose was
somewhat ambiguous; but Pen had fraternised with
the officers on the Pincio, had learnedly discussed
Chopin and Stephen Heller with them, had been
assured that they did not mean to fight for the Holy
Father, and had invited "ever so many of them" to
come and see mamma&#8212;an invitation which they were
too discreet to accept. Mrs Browning's excitement
about public affairs had somewhat abated; yet she
watched with deep interest the earlier stages of the great
struggle in America; and she did not falter in her
hopes for Italy; by intrigues and smuggling the
newspapers which she wished to see were obtained
through the courteous French generals. But her
spirits were languid; "I gather myself up by fits
and starts," she confesses, "and then fall back."</p>
<p>Apart from his anxieties for his wife's health and
the unfailing pleasure in his boy, whom a French or
Italian abb&eacute; now instructed, Browning was wholly
absorbed in one new interest. He had long been an
accomplished musician; in Paris he had devoted
himself to drawing; now his passion was for modelling
in clay, and the work proceeded under the direction
and in the studio of his friend, the sculptor Story.
<a name="Page_222"></a>His previous studies in anatomy stood him in
good
stead; he made remarkable progress, and six hours
a day passed as if in an enchantment. He ceased
even to read; "nothing but clay does he care for,"
says Mrs Browning smilingly, "poor lost soul." The
union of intellectual energy with physical effort in
such work gave him the complete satisfaction for
which he craved. His wife "grudged a little," she
says, the time stolen from his special art of poetry;
but she saw that his health and spirits gained from
his happy occupation. Of late, he had laboured
irregularly at verse; fits of active effort were followed
by long intervals during which production seemed
impossible. And some vent was necessary for the
force coiled up within him; if this were not to be
obtained, he wore himself out with a nervous impatience&#8212;"beating
his dear head," as Mrs Browning
describes it, "against the wall, simply because he sees
a fly there, magnified by his own two eyes almost
indefinitely into some Saurian monster." Now he was
well and even exultant&#8212;"nothing ever," he declared,
"made him so happy before." Of advancing years&#8212;Browning
was now nearly forty-nine&#8212;the only
symptoms were that he had lost his youthful slightness
of figure, and that his beard and hair were somewhat
blanched by time. "The women," his wife wrote to
his sister, "adore him everywhere far too much for
decency," and to herself he seemed "infinitely handsomer
and more attractive" than when, sixteen years
previously, she had first seen him. On the whole
therefore she was well pleased with his new passion
for clay, and could wish for him loads of the plastic
stuff in which to riot. Afterwards, in his days of
<a name="Page_223"></a>sorrow in London, when he compared the colour of
his life to that of a snow-cloud, it seemed to him as
if one minute of these months at Rome would yield
him gold enough to make the brightness of a year;
he longed for the smell of the wet clay in Story's
studio, where the songs of the birds, and the bleat
of a goat coming through the little door to the
left, were heard.<a name="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>
<p>While hoping and planning for the future, his wife
was not unaware of her own decline. "For the first
time," she writes about December, "I have had pain
in looking into Penini's face lately&#8212;which you will
understand." And a little earlier: "I wish to live
just as long as, and no longer than to grow in the
soul." The winter was mild, though snow had fallen
once; a spell of colder weather was reserved for the
month of May. They thought of meeting Browning's
father and sister in some picturesque part of the forest
of Fontainebleau, or, if that should prove unsuitable,
perhaps at Trouville. Mrs Browning, who had
formerly enjoyed the stir of life in Paris, now shrank
from its noise and bustle. Her wish would be to
creep into a cave for the whole year. At eight o'clock
each evening she left her sitting-room and sofa, and
was in bed. Yet she trusted that when she could
venture again into the open air she would be more
capable of enduring the friction of the world. In
May she felt stronger, and saw visitors, among whom
was Hans Andersen, "very earnest, very simple, very
childlike."<a name="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a>
A little later she was cast down by the
<a name="Page_224"></a>death of Cavour&#8212;"that great soul which meditated
and made Italy"; she could hardly trust herself to
utter his name. It was evident to Browning that the
journey to France could not be undertaken without
serious risk. They had reached Casa Guidi, and there
for the present she must take her rest.</p>
<p>The end came swiftly, gently. A bronchial attack,
attended with no more than the usual discomfort,
found her with diminished power of resistance.
Browning had forebodings of evil, though there
seemed to be no special cause to warrant his apprehension.
On the last evening&#8212;June 28, 1861&#8212;she
herself had no anticipation of what was at hand,
and talked of their summer plans. When she slept,
her slumber was heavy and disturbed. At four in
the morning her husband was alarmed and sent to
summon the doctor; but she assured him that his
fears were exaggerated. Then inestimable words
were spoken which lived forever in his heart. And
so "smilingly, happily, with a face like a girl's," resting
her head upon her husband's cheek, she passed away.<a name="FNanchor_83"></a><a

<p> "Browning was intimately acquainted," writes Miss Anna
Swanwick,
"with Salvini." What especially lived in Browning's memory as
transcending
everything else he had witnessed on the stage was Salvini's
impersonation of the blind Oedipus, and in particular one incident: a
hand is laid on the blind man's shoulder, which he supposes the hand of
one of his sons; he discovers it to be the hand of Antigone; the sudden
transition from a look of fiery hate to one of ineffable tenderness was
unsurpassable in its mastery of dramatic expression. (Condensed from

61-68: "She talked with him and jested and gave expression to her love
in the tenderest words; then, feeling sleepy, and he supporting her in
his arms, she fell into a doze. In a few minutes, suddenly, her head
dropped forward. He thought she had fainted, but she had gone for
ever." A painful account of the funeral service, "blundered through
by a fat English parson," is given by Story.</p>

<h2>London: Dramatis Personae</h2>
<br />
<p>The grief of the desolate man was an uncontrollable
passion; his heart was strong and all its strength
entered into its sorrow. Miss Blagden, "perfect in all
kindness," took motherly possession of the boy, and
persuaded his father to accompany Penini to her villa
at Bellosguardo. When all that was needful at Casa
Guidi had been done, Browning's first thought was to
abandon Italy for many a year, and hasten to London,
there to have speech for a day or two at least with
Mrs Browning's sister Arabel. "The cycle is complete,"
he said, looking round the sitting-room of Casa
Guidi. "I want my new life," he wrote, "to resemble
the last fifteen years as little as possible." Yet while
he stayed in the accustomed rooms he held himself
together; "when I was moved," he says, "I began to
go to pieces."<a name="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a>
Yet something remained to sustain him.</p>
<p>To one who has habitually given as well as received
much not the least of the pangs of separation arises
from the incapacity to render any further direct
service. It fortified Browning's heart to know that
much could be done, and in ways which his wife would
have approved and desired, for her child. And as he
himself had been also her care, it was his business now
<a name="Page_226"></a>to see that his life fulfilled itself aright.
Yet he breaks
out in July: "No more 'house-keeping' for me, even
with my family. I shall grow still, I hope&#8212;but my
root is taken, and remains." From the outward
paraphernalia of death Browning, as Mrs Orr notices,
shrank with aversion; it was partly the instinct by
which a man seeks to preserve what is most sacred
and most strong in his own feelings from the poor
materialisms and the poor sentimentalisms of the grave;
partly a belief that any advance of the heart towards
what has been lost may be rather hindered than helped
by the external circumstance surrounding the forsaken
body. Browning took measures that his wife's grave
should be duly cared for, given more than common
distinction; but Florence became a place from which
even for his own sake and the sake of her whose
spirit lived within him he must henceforth keep
aloof.</p>
<p>The first immediate claim upon Browning was that
of duty to his father. On August 1st he left Florence
for Paris, accompanied by Isa Blagden, who still
watched over him and the boy. Two months were
spent with his sister and the old man, still hale and
strong of heart, at a place "singularly unspoiled, fresh
and picturesque, and lovely to heart's content"&#8212;so
Browning describes it&#8212;St Enogat, near St Malo.
The solitary sea, the sands, the rocks, the green country
gave him at least a breathing-space. Then he proceeded
to London, not without an outbreak of his
characteristic energy in over-coming the difficulties&#8212;which
involved two hours of "weary battling"&#8212;of
securing a horse-box for Pen's pony. At Amiens
Tennyson, with his wife and children, was on the
<a name="Page_227"></a>platform. Browning pulled his hat over his face
and
was unrecognised.<a name="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a>
In "grim London," as he had
called it, though with a quick remorse at recollection
of the kindness awaiting him, he had the comfort of
daily intercourse with Miss Arabel Barrett.</p>
<p>It was decided that an English education, but not
that of a public school, would be best for the boy;
the critical time for taking "the English stamp" must
not be lost; his father's instruction, aided by that of
a tutor, would suffice to prepare him for the University,
and he would have the advantage of the motherly
care of his mother's favourite sister. Browning distrusted,
he says to Story, "ambiguous natures and
nationalities." Thus he bound himself to England
and to London, while at times he sighed for the beauty
of Italian hills and skies. He shrank from society,
although before long old friends, and especially Procter,
infirm and deaf, were not neglected. He found, or
made, business for himself; had "never so much to
do or so little pleasure in doing it." The discomfort
of London lodgings was before long exchanged for
the more congenial surroundings of a house by the
water-side in Warwick Crescent, which he occupied
until 1887, two years before his death. The furniture
and tapestries of Casa Guidi gave it an air of
comfort and repose. "It was London," writes Mrs
Ritchie, referring to her visits of a later date, "but
London touched by some indefinite romance; the
canal used to look cool and deep, the green trees used
to shade the Crescent.... The house was an ordinary
London house, but the carved oak furniture and
tapestries gave dignity to the long drawing-rooms, and
<a name="Page_228"></a>pictures and books lined the stairs. In the
garden at
the back dwelt, at the time of which I am writing, two
weird gray geese, with quivering silver wings and long
throats, who used to come and meet their master
hissing and fluttering." In 1866 an owl&#8212;for Browning
still indulged a fantasy of his own in the choice
of pets&#8212;was "the light of our house," as a letter
describes this bird of darkness, "for his tameness and
engaging ways." The bird would kiss its master on
the face, tweak his hair, and if one said "Poor old
fellow!" in a commiserating voice would assume
a sympathetic air of depression.<a name="FNanchor_86"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> Miss Barrett lived
hard by, in Delamere Terrace. With her on Sundays
Browning listened at Bedford Chapel to the sermons
of a non-conformist preacher, Thomas Jones, to some
of which when published in 1884, he prefixed an introduction.
"The Welsh poet-preacher" was a man of
humble origin possessed of a natural gift of eloquence,
which, with his "liberal humanity," drew Browning to
become a hearer of his discourses.</p>
<p>He made no haste to give the public a new volume
of verse. Mrs Browning had mentioned to a correspondent,
not long before her death, that her husband
had then a considerable body of lyrical poetry in a
state of completion. An invitation to accept the
editorship of the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, on Thackeray's
retirement, was after some hesitation declined. He
was now partly occupied with preparing for the press
whatever writings by his wife seemed suitable for
publication. In 1862 he issued with a dedication "to
grateful Florence" her <i>Last Poems</i>; in 1863, her
<i>Greek Christian Poets</i>; in 1865 he prepared a volume
<a name="Page_229"></a>of Selections from her poems, and had the
happiness
of knowing that the number of her readers had rather
increased than diminished. The efforts of self-constituted
biographers to make capital out of the incidents
of her life, and to publish such letters of hers as could
be laid hands on, moved him to transports of indignation,
which break forth in a letter to his friend Miss
Blagden with unmeasured violence: what he felt with
the "paws" of these blackguards in his "very bowels"
God knows; beast and scamp and knave and fool
are terms hardly strong enough to relieve his wrath.
Such sudden whirls of extreme rage were rare, yet
were characteristic of Browning, and were sometimes
followed by regret for his own distemperature. In
1862 a gratifying task was laid on him&#8212;that of
superintending the three volume edition of his Poetical
Works which was published in the following year.
At the same time his old friend Forster, with help from
Procter, was engaged in preparing the first&#8212;and the
best&#8212;of the several Selections from Browning's poems;
it was at once an indication of the growing interest in
his writings and an effective means towards extending
their influence. He set himself steadily to work out what
was in him; he waited no longer upon his casual moods,
but girded his loins and kept his lamp constantly lit.
His genius, such as it was&#8212;this was the field given him
to till, and he must see that it bore fruit. "I certainly
will do my utmost to make the most of my poor self before
I die"&#8212;so he wrote in 1865. There were gains in
such a resolved method of work; but there were also
losses. A man of so active a mind by planting
himself before a subject could always find something
to say; but it might happen that such sheer brain-<a name="Page_230"></a>work
was carried on by plying other faculties than
those which give its highest value to poetry.<a name="FNanchor_87"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>
<p>In the late summer and early autumn of 1862
Browning, in company with his son, was among the
Pyrenees at "green pleasant little Cambo, and then at
Biarritz crammed," he says, "with gay people of whom
I know nothing but their outsides." The sea and
sands were more to his liking than the gay people.<a name="FNanchor_88"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a>
He had with him one book and no other&#8212;a Euripides,
in which he read vigorously, and that the readings
were fruitful his later poetry of the Greek drama bears
witness. At present however his creative work lay in
another direction; the whole of "the Roman murder
story"&#8212;the story of Pompilia and Guido and
Caponsacchi&#8212;he describes as being pretty well in his
head. It needed a long process of evolution before
the murder story could uncoil its sinuous lengths in a
series of volumes. The visit to Ste-Marie "a wild
little place in Brittany" near Pornic, in the summer of
1863&#8212;a visit to be repeated in the two summers
immediately succeeding&#8212;is directly connected with
two of the poems of <i>Dramatis Personae</i>. The story
of <i>Gold Hair</i> and the landscape details of <i>James Lee's
Wife</i> are alike derived from Pornic. The solitude of
the little Breton hamlet soothed Browning's spirit.
The "good, stupid and dirty" people of the village
<a name="Page_231"></a>were seldom visible except on Sunday; there were
solitary walks of miles to be had along the coast;
fruit and milk, butter and eggs in abundance, and
these were Browning's diet. "I feel out of the very
earth sometimes," he wrote, "as I sit here at the
window.... Such a soft sea, and such a mournful
wind!" But the lulling charm of the place which,
though so different, brought back the old Siena mood,
did not convert him into an idler. The mornings,
which began betimes, were given to work; in his way
of desperate resolve to be well occupied he informs
Miss Blagden (Aug. 18, 1863) that having yesterday
written a poem of 120 lines, he means to keep writing
whether he likes it or not.<a name="FNanchor_89"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>
<p>"With the spring of 1863," writes Mr Gosse, "a
great change came over Browning's habits. He had
refused all invitations into society; but now, of evenings,
after he had put his boy to bed, the solitude
weighed intolerably upon him. He told the present
writer [Mr Gosse] long afterwards, that it suddenly
occurred to him on one such spring night in 1863 that
this mode of life was morbid and unworthy, and, then
and there, he determined to accept for the future every
suitable invitation which came to him." "Accordingly,"
goes on Mr Gosse, "he began to dine out, and in
the process of time he grew to be one of the most
familiar figures of the age at every dinner-table,
concert-hall, and place of refined entertainment in
London. This, however, was a slow process." Mrs
Ritchie refers to spoken words of Browning which
<a name="Page_232"></a>declared that it was "a mere chance whether he
should
live in the London house that he had taken and join
in social life, or go away to some quiet retreat, and be
seen no more." It was in a modified form the story of
the "fervid youth grown man," in his own "Daniel
Bartoli," who in his desolation, after the death of
his lady,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Trembled on the verge<br />
</span><span>Of monkhood: trick of cowl and taste of scourge<br />
</span><span>He tried: then, kicked not at the pricks perverse,<br />
</span><span>But took again, for better or for worse,<br />
</span><span>The old way of the world, and, much the same<br />
</span><span>Man o' the outside, fairly played life's game.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Probably Browning had come to understand that in
his relation to the past he was not more loyal in
solitude than he might be in society; it was indeed
the manlier loyalty to bear his full part in life. And
as to his art, he felt that, with sufficient leisure to
encounter the labour he had enjoined upon himself,
it mattered little whether the remaining time was spent
in a cave or in a court; strength may encounter the
seductions either of the hermitage or of the crowd and
still be the victor:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Strength may conclude in Archelaos' court,<br />
</span><span>And yet esteem the silken company<br />
</span><span>So much sky-scud, sea-froth, earth-thistledown,<br />
</span><span>For aught their praise or blame should joy or grieve.<br />
</span><span>Strength amid crowds as late in solitude<br />
</span><span>May lead the still life, ply the wordless task.<a
 name="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a><br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>One cannot prescribe a hygiene to poets; the poet
of passionate contemplation, such as was Wordsworth,
could hardly quicken or develop his peculiar faculty
<a name="Page_233"></a>by devotion to the entertainments of successive
London seasons. And perhaps it is not certain that
the genius of Browning was wholly a gainer by the
superficial excitations of the dinner table and the
reception room. But the truth is, as Mrs Browning
had observed, that his energy was not exhausted by
literary work, and that it preyed upon himself if no
means of escape were found. If he was not at the
piano, or shaping clay, or at the drawing-board, or
walking fast and far, inward disturbances were set up
which rent and frayed his mind. The pleasures of
society both fatigued and rested Browning; they
certainly relieved him from the troubles of super-abundant
force.</p>
<p>In 1864 <i>Dramatis Personae</i> was published. It
might be described as virtually a third volume of <i>Men
and Women</i>. And yet a certain change of tone is
discernible. Italy is no longer the background of
the human figures. There is perhaps less opulence
of colour; less of the manifold "joys of living." If
higher points in the life of the spirit are not touched,
the religious feeling has more of inwardness and is
more detached from external historical fact than it had
ever been before; there is more sense of resistance to
and victory over whatever may seem adverse to the
life of the soul. In the poems which deal with love
the situations and postures of the spirit are less simple
and are sometimes even strained; the fantastic and
the grotesque occupy a smaller place; a plain dignity, a
grave solemnity of style is attained in passages of <i>A
Death in the Desert</i>, which had hardly been reached
before. Yet substantially the volume is a continuation
of the poems of 1855; except in one instance, where
<a name="Page_234"></a>Tennyson's method in <i>Maud</i>, that of a
sequence of
lyrics, is adopted, the methods are the same; the
predominating themes of <i>Men and Women</i>, love, art,
religion, are the predominating themes of <i>Dramatis
Personae.</i> A slight metrical complication&#8212;the internal
rhyme in the second line of each stanza of <i>D&icirc;s aliter
visum</i> and in the third line of the quatrains of <i>May
and Death</i>&#8212;may be noted as indicating Browning's love
of new metrical experiments. In the former of these
poems the experiment cannot be called a success; the
clash of sounds, "a mass of brass," "walked and
talked," and the like, seems too much as if an accident
had been converted into a rule.</p>
<p><i>Mr Sludge, "the Medium</i>" the longest piece in the
volume, has been already noticed. The story of the
poor girl of Pornic, as Browning in a letter calls her,
attracted him partly because it presented a psychological
curiosity, partly because he cared to paint her
hair in words,&#8212;gold in contrast with that pallid face&#8212;as
much as his friend Rossetti might have wished
to display a like splendour with the strokes of his
brush:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Hair such a wonder of flix and floss,<br />
</span><span>Freshness and fragrance&#8212;floods of it too!<br />
</span><span>Gold, did I say? Nay, gold's mere dross.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The story, which might gratify a cynical observer
of human nature, is treated by Browning without a
touch of cynicism, except that ascribed to the priest&#8212;good
easy man&#8212;who has lost a soul and gained an
altar. A saint <i>manqu&eacute;</i>, whose legend is gruesome
enough, but more pathetic than gruesome, becomes for
the poet an involuntary witness of the Christian faith,
and a type of the mystery of moral evil; but the
<a name="Page_235"></a>psychological contrasts of the ambiguous
creature,
saint-sinner, and the visual contrast of</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>that face, like a silver wedge<br />
</span><span>'Mid the yellow wealth,<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>are of more worth than the sermon which the writer
preaches in exposition of his tale. Had the form of
the poem been Browning's favourite dramatic monologue,
we can imagine that an ingenious apologia,
convincing at least to Half-Pornic, could have been
offered for the perversity of the dying girl's rifting
every golden tress with gold.</p>
<p>No poem in the volume of <i>Dramatis Personae</i> is
connected with pictorial art, unless it be the few lines
entitled <i>A Face</i>, lines of which Emily Patmore, the
poet's wife, was the subject, and written, as Browning
seldom wrote, for the mere record of beauty. That
"little head of hers" is transferred to Browning's
panel in the manner of an early Tuscan piece of ideal
loveliness; in purity of outline and of colour the
delicate profile, the opening lips, the neck, the chin so
naturally ally themselves to painting that nature is
best comprehended through its imaginative transference
to art. As <i>Master Hugues</i> of the earlier collection
of poems converts a bewildering technique of
music into poetry, and discovers in its intricate construction
a certain interposing web spun by the brain
between the soul and things divine, so <i>Abt Vogler</i>
interprets music on the other side&#8212;that of immediate
inspiration, to which the constructive element&#8212;real
though slight&#8212;is subordinate. In the silence and
vacuity which follow the impromptu on his orchestrion,
the composer yearns, broods, aspires. Never were a
<a name="Page_236"></a>ghostly troop of sounds reanimated and
incarnated
into industrious life more actually than by Browning's
verse. They climb and crowd, they mount and march,
and then pass away; but the musician's spirit is borne
onward by the wind of his own mood, and it cannot
stay its flight until it has found rest in God; all that
was actual of harmonious sound has collapsed; but
the sense of a mystery of divine suggestion abides in
his heart; the partial beauty becomes a pledge of
beauty in its plenitude; and then by a gentle return
upon himself he resumes the life of every day, sobered,
quieted and comforted. The poem touches the
borderland where art and religion meet. The <i>Toccata
of Galuppi</i> left behind as its relics the melancholy of
mundane pleasure and a sense of its transitory existence.
The extemporising of <i>Abt Vogler</i> fills the
void which it has opened with the substance of things
hoped for, the evidence of things unseen.</p>
<p>Faith, victor over loss, in <i>Abt Vogler</i>, is victor over
temporal decay in <i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i>. The poem is the
song of triumph of devout old age. Neither the
shrunken sadness of Matthew Arnold's poem on old
age, nor the wise moderation and acquiescence in the
economy of force which an admirable poem by
Emerson expresses, can be found here; and perhaps
some stress and strain may be felt in Browning's effort
to maintain his position. It is no "vale of years" of
which <i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i> tells; old age is viewed as an
apex, a pinnacle, from which in thin translucent air
all the efforts and all the errors of the past can be reviewed;
the gifts of youth, the gifts of the flesh are
not depreciated; but the highest attainment is that
of knowledge won by experience&#8212;knowledge which
<a name="Page_237"></a>can divide good from evil and what is true from
what
merely seems, knowledge which can put a just valuation
not only on deeds but on every faint desire and
unaccomplished purpose, and not only on achievements
but failures. Possessed of such knowledge,
tried in the probation of life and not found wanting,
accepting its own peculiar trials, old age can enter
into the rest of a clear and solemn vision, confident
of being qualified at last to start forth upon that
"adventure brave and new" to which death is a
summons, and assured through experience that the
power which gives our life its law is equalled by a
superintending love. Ardour, and not lethargy, progress
and not decline, are here represented as the
characteristics of extreme old age. An enthusiasm
of effort and of strenuous endurance, an enthusiasm
of rest in knowledge, an enthusiasm of self-abandonment
to God and the divine purpose make
up the poem. At no time did Browning write
verse which soars with a more steadfast and impassioned
libration of wing. Death in <i>Rabbi Ben
Ezra</i> is death as a friend. In the lines entitled
<i>Prospice</i> it is death the adversary that is confronted
and conquered; the poem is an act of the faith which
comes through love; it is ascribed to no imaginary
speaker, and does not, indeed, veil its personal character.
No lonely adventure is here to reward the
victor over death; the transcendent joy is human
love recovered, which being once recovered, let whatever
God may please succeed. The verses are a
confession which gives the reason of that gallant
beating up against the wind, noticeable in many of
Browning's later poems. He could not cease from
<a name="Page_238"></a>hope; but hope and faith had much to encounter,
and sometimes he would reduce the grounds of his
hope to the lowest, as if to make sure against illusion
and to test the fortitude of hope even at its weakest.
The hope of immortality which was his own inevitably
extended itself beyond himself, and became an interpreter
of the mysteries of our earthly life. In
contrast with the ardent ideality of <i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i>
may be set the uncompromising realism of <i>Apparent
Failure</i>, with its poetry of the Paris morgue. The
lover of life will scrutinise death at its ugliest and
worst, blinking no hideous fact. Yet, even so, the
reverence for humanity&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Poor men, God made, and all for that!&#8212;<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>is not quenched, nor is the hope quenched that</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>After Last returns the First,<br />
</span><span>Though a wide compass round be fetched,<br />
</span><span>That what began best, can't end worst.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The optimism is unreasoned, and rightly so, for the
spirit of the poem, with its suggestive title, is not
argumentative. The sense of "the pity of it" in one
heart, remorse which has somehow come into existence
out of the obscure storehouse of nature, or out
of God, is the only justification suggested for a hope
that nature or God must at the last intend good and
not evil to the poor defeated abjects, who most abhorred
their lives in Paris yesterday. And the word "Nature"
here would be rejected by Browning as less than the truth.</p>
<p>In 1864 under somewhat altered conditions, and
from a ground somewhat shifted, Browning in <i>A
Death in the Desert</i> and the <i>Epilogue</i> to "Dramatis
Personae" continued his apology for the Christian
<a name="Page_239"></a>faith. The apologetics are, however, in the
first
instance poems, and they remain poems at the last.
The imaginary scene of the death of the Evangelist
John is rendered with the finest art; its dignity is
that of a certain noble bareness; in the dim-lighted
grotto are the aged disciple and the little group of
witnesses to whom he utters his legacy of words; at
the cave's edge is the Bactrian crying from time to
time his bird-like cry of assurance:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Outside was all noon and the burning blue.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The slow return of the dying man to consciousness
of his surroundings is as true as if it were studied
from a death-bed; his sudden awakening at the
words "I am the Resurrection and the Life" arrives
not as a dramatic surprise but as the simplest surprise
of nature&#8212;light breaking forth before sunset. The
chief speaker of the poem is chosen because the
argument is one concerning faith that comes through
love, and St John was the disciple who had learnt
love's deepest secrets. The dialectic proceeds along
large lines, which have only the subtlety of simplicity.
The verse moves gravely, tenderly, often weighted
with monosyllables; a pondering, dwelling verse; and
great single lines arise so naturally that while they
fill the mind with a peculiar power, they are felt to be
of one texture with the whole: this, for example,&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>We would not lose<br />
</span><span>The last of what might happen on his face;<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>and this:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>When there was mid sea and the mighty things;<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>and this:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Lie bare to the universal prick of light;<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_240"></a>and these:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The Bactrian was but a wild childish man,<br />
</span><span>And could not write nor speak, but only loved.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Such lines, however, are made to be read <i>in situ</i>.</p>
<p>The faith of these latter days is the same as that
of the first century, and is not the same. The story
and the teaching of Christ had alike one end&#8212;to
plant in the human consciousness the assurance of
Divine Love, and to make us, in our degree, conscious
partakers of that love. Where love is, there is Christ.
Our conceptions of God are relative to our own understanding;
but God as power, God as a communicating
intelligence, God as love&#8212;Father, Son and Spirit&#8212;is
the utmost that we can conceive of things above us.
Let us now put that knowledge&#8212;imperfect though
it may be&#8212;to use. Power, intelligence, love&#8212;these
surround us everywhere; they are not mere projections
from our own brain or hand or heart; and by us they
are inconceivable otherwise than as personal attributes.
The historical story of Christ is not lost, for it has
grown into a larger assurance of faith. We are not
concerned with the linen clothes and napkins of the
empty sepulchre; Christ is arisen. Why revert to
discuss miracles? The work of miracles&#8212;whatever
they may have been&#8212;was long ago accomplished.
The knowledge of the Divine Love, its appropriation
by our own hearts, and the putting forth of that love
in our lives&#8212;such for us is the Christian faith, such is
the work of Christ accomplishing itself in humanity at
the present time. And the Christian story is no myth
but a reality, not because we can prove true the beliefs
of the first century, but because those beliefs contained
<a name="Page_241"></a>within them a larger and more enduring belief.
The
acorn has not perished because it has expanded into
an oak.</p>
<p>This, reduced here to the baldest statement, is in
substance the dying testimony of Browning's St John.
It is thrown into lyrical form as his own testimony
in the <i>Epilogue</i> to the volume of 1864. The voices
of singers, the sound of the trumpets of the Jewish
Dedication Day, when the glory of the Lord in His
cloud filled His house, have fallen silent. We are
told by some that the divine Face, known to early
Christian days as love, has withdrawn from earth for
ever, and left humanity enthroned as its sole representative:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Oh, dread succession to a dizzy post,<br />
</span><span>Sad sway of sceptre whose mere touch appals.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Browning's reply is that to one whose eyes are
rightly informed the whole of nature and of human
life shows itself as a perpetual mystery of providential
care:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Why, where's the need of Temple, when the
walls<br />
</span><span>O' the world are that? What use of swells and falls<br />
</span><span>From Levites' choir, Priests' cries, and trumpet calls?<br />
</span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span>That one Face, far from vanish, rather grows,<br />
</span><span>Or decomposes but to recompose,<br />
</span><span>Become my universe that feels and knows.<a
 name="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a><br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>In the great poem of 1868-69, <i>The Ring and the
Book</i>, one speaker, the venerable Pope, like St John of
<a name="Page_242"></a><i>A Death in the Desert</i>, has almost reached
the term of
a long life: he is absorbed in the solemn weighing of
truth and falsehood, good and evil; his soul, like the
soul of the dying Evangelist:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Lies bare to the universal prick of light.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>He, if any of the speakers in that sequence of monologues,
expresses Browning's own highest thought.
And the Pope's exposition of the Christianity of our
modern age is identical with that of John. Man's
mind is but "a convex glass" in which is represented
all that by us can be conceived of God, "our known
unknown." The Pope has heard the Christian story
which is abroad in the world; he loves it and finds it
credible. God's power&#8212;that is clearly discernible in
the universe; His intelligence&#8212;that is no less evidently
present. What of love? The dread machinery of sin
and sorrow on this globe of ours seems to negative the
idea of divine love. The surmise of immortality may
indeed justify the ways of God to man; this "dread
machinery" may be needed to evolve man's highest
moral qualities. The acknowledgment of God in
Christ, the divine self-sacrifice of love, for the Pope,
as for St John, solves</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>All questions in the earth and out of it.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>But whether the truth of the early centuries be an
absolute historic fact,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Or only truth reverberate, changed, made pass<br />
</span><span>A spectrum into mind, the narrow eye&#8212;<br />
</span><span>The same and not the same, else unconceived&#8212;<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>the Pope dare not affirm. Nor does he regard the
question as of urgent importance at the present day;
<a name="Page_243"></a>the effect of the Christian tale&#8212;historic fact,
or higher
fact expressed in myth&#8212;remains:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>So my heart be struck,<br />
</span><span>What care I,&#8212;by God's gloved hand or the bare?<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>By some means, means divinely chosen even if but a
child's fable-book, we have got our truth, and it suffices
for our training here on earth. Let us give over the endless
task of unproving and re-proving the already proved;
rather let us straightway put our truth to its proper uses.<a
 name="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>
<p>If the grotesque occupies a comparatively small
place in <i>Dramatis Personae</i>, the example given is of
capital importance in this province of Browning's art.
The devil of Notre Dame, looking down on Paris, is
more effectively placed, but is hardly a more impressive
invention of Gothic fantasy than Caliban sprawling in
the pit's much mire,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>With elbows wide, fists clenched to prop his
chin,<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>while he discourses, with a half-developed consciousness,
itself in the mire and scarcely yet pawing to get
free, concerning the nature of his Creator. The
grotesque here is not merely of the kind that addresses
the eye; the poem is an experiment in the grotesque
of thought; and yet fantastic as it seems, the whole
process of this monstrous Bridgewater treatise is
governed by a certain logic. The poem, indeed, is
<a name="Page_244"></a>essentially a fragment of Browning's own
Christian
apologetics; it stands as a burly gate-tower from which
boiling pitch can be flung upon the heads of assailants.
The poet's intention is not at all to give us a chapter
in the origins of religion; nor is Caliban a representative
of primitive man. A frequently recurring idea
with Browning is that expressed by Pope Innocent in
the passage already cited; the external world proves
the power of God; it proves His intelligence: but the
proof of love is derived exclusively from the love that
lives in the heart of man. Are you dissatisfied with
such a proof? Well, then, see what a god we can
construct out of intelligence and power, with love left
out! If this world is not a place of trial and training
appointed by love, then it is a scene of capricious
cruelty or capricious indifference on the part of our
Maker; His providence is a wanton sporting with our
weakness and our misery. Why were we brought into
being? To amuse His solitary and weary intelligence,
and to become the victims or the indulged manifestations
of His power. Why is one man selected for extreme
agony from which a score of his fellows escape?
Because god Setebos resembles Caliban, when through
mere caprice he lets twenty crabs march past him
unhurt and stones the twenty-first,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Loving not, hating not, just choosing so.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>If any of the phenomena of nature lead us to infer
or imagine some law superior to the idle artistry
and reckless will of Setebos, that law is surely very
far away; it is "the Quiet" of Caliban's theology
which takes no heed of human life and has for its
outposts the cold unmoving stars.</p>
<p><a name="Page_245"></a>Except the short piece named <i>May and Death</i>,
which like Rossetti's poem of the wood-spurge, is
founded upon one of those freaks of association that
make some trival object the special remembrancer of
sorrow, the remaining poems of <i>Dramatis Personae</i>,
as originally published, are all poems of love. <i>A
Likeness</i>, skilfully contrived in the indirect directness
of its acknowledgment of love, its jealous privacy of
passion, and its irresistible delight in the homage
rendered by one who is not a lover, is no
exception. Not one of these poems tells of the
full assurance and abiding happiness of lovers. But
the warmth and sweetness of early passion are alive
under the most disastrous circumstances in <i>Confessions</i>.
The apothecary with his bottles provides a chart of
the scene of the boy-and-girl adventures; the professional
gravities of the parson put an edge on the
memory of the dear indiscretions; "summer's distillation,"
to borrow a word from Shakespeare, makes
faint the odour of the bottle labelled "Ether"; the
mummy wheat from the coffin of old desire sprouts
up and waves its green pennons. <i>Youth and Art</i> may
be placed beside the earlier <i>Respectability</i> as two pages
out of the history of the encounters of prudence and
passion; youth and maiden alike, boy-sculptor and
girl-singer, prefer the prudence of worldly success to
the infinite prudence of love; and they have their
reward&#8212;that success in life which is failure. Like
the tedious brief scene of young Pyramus and Thisbe,
this is a poem of "very tragical mirth." And no less
tragically mirthful is <i>D&icirc;s Aliter Visum</i>, a variation
on the same or a kindred theme, where our young
Bohemian sculptor is replaced by the elderly poet,
<a name="Page_246"></a>bent, wigged, and lamed, but sure of the
fortieth
chair in the Academy, and the lone she-sparrow of
the house-top by a young beauty, who adds to her
other attractions a vague, uninstructed yearning for
culture and entirely substantial possessions in the
three-per-cents. But the moral is the same&#8212;the folly
of being overwise, the wisdom of acting upon the
best promptings of the heart. In <i>Too Late</i> Browning
attempts to render a mood of passionate despair;&#8212;love
and the hopes of love are defeated by a
woman's sentence of rejection, her marriage, and, last,
her death; it reads, more than any other poem of the
writer, like a leaf torn out of "Wuthering Heights."
There is a fixity of grief which is more appalling
than this whirlblast; the souls that are wedged in
ice occupy a lower circle in the region of sorrow
than those which are driven before the gale. <i>The
Worst of it</i>&#8212;another poem of the failures of love&#8212;reverses
the conventional attitude of the wronged
husband; he ought, according to all recognised authorities
of drama and novel, rage against his faithless
wife, and commiserate his virtuous self; here he endeavours,
though vainly, to transfer every stain and
shame to himself from her; his anguish is all on her
behalf, or if on his own chiefly because he cannot
restore her purity or save her from her wrong done
against herself. It is a poem of moral stress and
strain, imagined with great intensity. Browning in
general isolates a single moment or mood of passion,
and studies it, with its shifting lights and shadows,
as a living microcosm; often it is a moment of crisis,
a moment of culmination. For once in <i>James Lee's
Wife</i> (named in the first edition by a stroke of per<a
 name="Page_247"></a>versity
<i>James Lee</i>), he represents in a sequence of
lyrics a sequence of moods, and with singular success.
The season of the year is autumn, and autumn as
felt not among golden wheatfields, but on a barren
and rocky sea-coast; the processes of the declining
year, from the first touch of change to bareness everywhere,
accompany and accord with those of the
decline of hope in the wife's heart for any return of
her love. Her offence is that she has loved too
well; that she has laid upon her husband too great
a load of devotion; hostility might be met and vanquished;
but how can she deal with a heart which
love itself only petrifies? It should be a warning
to critics who translate dramatic poems into imaginary
biography to find that Browning, who had known so
perfect a success in the one love of his life, should
constantly present in work of imagination the ill
fortunes of love and lovers. Looking a little below
the surface we see that he could not write directly,
he could not speak effusively, of the joy that he had
known. But in all these poems he thinks of love as
a supreme possession in itself and as a revelation of
infinite things which lie beyond it; as a test of
character, and even as a pledge of perpetual advance
in the life of the spirit.</p>

<h2>The Ring and the Book</h2>
<br />
<p>The publication of <i>Dramatis Personae</i> marks an
advance in Browning's growing popularity; a second
edition, in which some improvements were effected,
was called for in 1864, the year of its first publication.
"All my new cultivators," Browning wrote, "are young
men"; many of them belonged to Oxford and Cambridge.
But he was resolved to consult his own taste,
to take his own way, and let popularity delay or
hasten as it would&#8212;"pleasing myself," he says, "or
aiming at doing so, and thereby, I hope, pleasing
God." His life had ordered itself as seemed best to
him&#8212;a life in London during the months in which
the tide flows and sparkles; then summer and autumn
quietude in some retreat upon the French coast. The
years passed in such a uniformity of work and rest,
with enjoyment accompanying each of these, that
they may almost be grasped in bundles. In 1865,
the holiday was again at Sainte-Marie, and the
weather was golden; but he noticed with regret that
the old church at Pornic, where the beautiful white
girl of his poem had been buried, was disappearing
to give space in front of a new and smart erection
of brick and stucco. His Florence, as he learnt, was
also altering, and he lamented the change. Every
detail of the Italian days lived in his memory; the
<a name="Page_249"></a>violets and ground ivy on a certain old wall;
the
fig tree behind the Siena villa, under which his wife
would sit and read, and "poor old Landor's oak." "I never
hear of any one going to Florence," he wrote in 1870,
"but my heart is twitched." He would like to "glide
for a long summer-day through the streets and between
the old stone-walls&#8212;unseen come and unheard go."
But he must guard himself against being overwhelmed
by recollection: "Oh, me! to find myself some late
sunshiny Sunday afternoon, with my face turned
to Florence&#8212;'ten minutes to the gate, ten minutes
<i>home</i>!' I think I should fairly end it all on the
spot."<a name="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>
<p>Other changes sadder than the loss of old Norman
pillars and ornaments, or new barbarous structures, run
up beside Poggio, were happening. In May 1866
Browning's father, kind and cheery old man, was
unwell; in June Miss Browning telegraphed for her
brother, and he arrived in Paris twenty-four hours
before the end. The elder Browning had almost
completed his eighty-fifth year. To the last he retained
what his son described as "his own strange
sweetness of soul." It was the close of a useful,
unworldly, unambitious life, full of innocent enjoyment
and deep affection. The occasion was not one for
intemperate grief, but the sense of loss was great.
Miss Browning, whose devotion during many years
first to her mother, then to her widowed father, had
been entire, now became her brother's constant
companion. They rested for the summer at Le
Croisic, a little town in Brittany, in a delightfully
spacious old house, with the sea to right and left,
<a name="Page_250"></a>through whose great rushing waves Browning loved
to battle, and, inland, a wild country, picturesque with
its flap-hatted, white-clad, baggy-breeched villagers.
Their enjoyment was unspoilt even by some weeks of
disagreeable weather, and to the same place, which
Browning has described in his <i>Two Poets of Croisic</i>&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Croisic, the spit of sandy rock which juts<br />
</span><span>Spitefully north,<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>they returned in the following summer. During this
second visit (September 1867) that most spirited
ballad of French heroism, <i>Herv&eacute; Riel</i>, was written,
though its publication belongs to four years later.<a name="FNanchor_94"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>
<p>In June 1868 came grief of a kind that seemed to
cut him off from outward communication with a
portion of what was most precious in his past life.
Arabel Barrett, his wife's only surviving sister, who
had supported him in his greatest sorrow, died in
Browning's arms. "For many years," we are told by
Mr Gosse, "he was careful never to pass her house in
Delamere Terrace." Although not prone to superstition,
he had noted in July 1863 a dream of Miss
Barrett in which she imagined herself asking her dead
sister Elizabeth, "When shall I be with you?" and
received the answer, "Dearest, in five years." "Only
a coincidence," he adds in a letter to Miss Blagden,
"but noticeable." That summer, after wanderings in
France, Browning and his sister settled at Audierne,
on the extreme westerly point of Brittany, "a delightful,
quite unspoiled little fishing town," with the ocean
in front and green lanes and hills behind. It was in
<a name="Page_251"></a>every way an eventful year. In the autumn his
new
publishers, Smith, Elder &amp; Co., produced the six-volume
edition of his Poetical Works, on the title-page
of which the author describes himself as "Robert
Browning, M.A., Honorary Fellow of Balliol College,
Oxford." The distinction, partly due to Jowett's
influence, had been conferred a year previously. In
1865, Browning, who desired that his son should be
educated at Oxford, first became acquainted with
Jowett. Acquaintance quickly ripened into friendship,
which was not the less genuine or cordial because Jowett
had but a qualified esteem for Browning's poems.
"Ought one to admire one's friend's poetry?" was a
difficult question of casuistry which the Master of
Balliol at one time proposed. Much of Browning's
work appeared to him to be "extravagant, perverse,
topsy-turvy"; "there is no rest in him," Jowett wrote
with special reference to the poems "Christmas Eve"
and "Easter Day," which he regarded as Browning's
noblest work. But for the man his admiration was
deep-based and substantial. After Browning's first
visit to him in June 1865, Jowett wrote that though
getting too old to make, as he supposed, new friends,
he had&#8212;he believed&#8212;made one. "It is impossible to
speak without enthusiasm of Mr Browning's open,
generous nature and his great ability and knowledge.
I had no idea that there was a perfectly sensible poet
in the world, entirely free from vanity, jealousy, or
any other littleness, and thinking no more of himself
than any ordinary man. His great energy is very
remarkable, and his determination to make the most
of the remainder of life. Of personal objects he
seems to have none except the education of his
<a name="Page_252"></a>son."<a name="FNanchor_95"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> Browning's visits to Oxford
and Cambridge did
not cease when he dropped away from the round of visiting
at country houses. He writes with frank enjoyment
of the almost interminable banquet given at
Balliol in the Lent Term, 1877, on the occasion of
the opening of the new Hall. Oxford conferred upon
him her D.C.L. in 1882, on which occasion a happy
undergraduate jester sent fluttering towards the new
Doctor's head an appropriate allusion in the form of a
red cotton night-cap. The Cambridge LL.D. was
conferred in 1879. In 1871 he was elected a Life
Governor of the University of London. In 1868 he
was invited to stand, with the certainty of election,
for the Lord Rectorship of the University of St
Andrews, as successor to John Stuart Mill, an honour
which he declined.<a name="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a>
The great event of this year in
the history of his authorship was the publication in
November and December of the first two volumes of
<i>The Ring and the Book</i>. The two remaining volumes
followed in January and February 1869.</p>

<h5>PIAZZA DI SAN LORENZO, FLORENCE, WHERE "THE BOOK"
WAS FOUND BY BROWNING.</h5>
<h5><i>From a photograph by</i> ALINARI.</h5>
<p>In June 1860 Browning lighted, among the litter
of odds and ends exposed for sale in the Piazza San
Lorenzo, Florence, upon the "square old yellow book,"
part print, part manuscript, which contained the crude
fact from which his poem of the Franceschini murder
case was developed. The price was a lira, "eightpence
English just." As he leaned by the fountain
and walked through street and street, he read, and
had mastered the contents before his foot was on the
<a name="Page_253"></a>threshold of Casa Guidi<a name="FNanchor_97"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a>. That night his brain was
a-work; pacing the terrace of Casa Guidi, while from
Felice church opposite came</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>the clear voice of the cloistered ones,<br />
</span><span>Chanting a chant made for mid-summer nights,<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>he gave himself up to the excitement of re-creating
the actors and re-enacting their deeds in his
imagination:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>I fused my live soul and that inert stuff,<br />
</span><span>Before attempting smithcraft.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>According to Mr Rudolf Lehmann, but possibly he
has antedated the incident, Browning at once conceived
the mode in which the subject could be treated in
poetry, and it was precisely the mode which was
afterwards adopted: "'When I had read the book,' so
Browning told me, 'my plan was at once settled. I
went for a walk, gathered twelve pebbles from the
road, and put them at equal distances on the parapet
that bordered it. Those represented the twelve
chapters into which the poem is divided, and I adhered
to that arrangement to the last.'"<a name="FNanchor_98"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> When in the autumn
he journeyed with his wife to Rome, the vellum-bound
quarto was with him, but the persons from whom he
sought further light about the murder and the trial
could give little information or none. Smithcraft did
not soon begin. He offered the story, "for prose
treatment" to Miss Ogle, so we are informed by Mrs
<a name="Page_254"></a>Orr, and, she adds, but with less assurance of
statement,
offered it "for poetic use to one of his leading
contemporaries." We have seen that in a letter of
1862 from Biarritz, Browning speaks of the Roman
murder case as being the subject of a new poem
already clearly conceived though unwritten. In the
last section of <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, he refers to
having been in close converse with his old quarto of
the Piazza San Lorenzo during four years:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>How will it be, my four-years' intimate,<br />
</span><span>When thou and I part company anon?<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The publication of <i>Dramatis Personae</i> in 1864
doubtless enabled Browning to give undivided attention
to his vast design. In October of that year he
advanced to actual definition of his scheme. When
staying in the south of France he visited the mountain
gorge which is connected with the adventure of the
Roland of romance, and there he planned the whole
poem precisely as it was carried out. "He says," Mr
W.M. Rossetti enters in his diary after a conversation
with Browning (15 March 1868), "he writes day by
day on a regular systematic plan&#8212;some three hours
in the early part of the day; he seldom or never,
unless in quite brief poems, feels the inspiring impulse
and sets the thing down into words at the same time&#8212;often
stores up a subject long before he writes it.
He has written his forthcoming work all consecutively&#8212;not
some of the later parts before the earlier."<a name="FNanchor_99"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>
<p>When Carlyle met Browning after the appearance
of <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, he desired to be complimentary,
but was hardly more felicitous than Browning
<a name="Page_255"></a>himself had sometimes been when under a like
necessity: "It is a wonderful book," declared Carlyle,
"one of the most wonderful poems ever written. I
re-read it all through&#8212;all made out of an Old Bailey
story that might have been told in ten lines, and only
wants forgetting."<a name="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a>
A like remark might have been
made respecting the book which, in its method and its
range of all English books most resembles Browning's
poem, and which may indeed be said to take among
prose works of fiction a similar place to that held
among poetical creations by Browning's tale of Guido
and Pompilia. Richardson's <i>Clarissa</i> consists of eight
volumes made out of an Old Bailey story, or what
might have been such, which one short newspaper
paragraph could have dismissed to a happy or sorrowful
oblivion. But then we should never have known two
of the most impressive figures invented by the imagination
of man, Clarissa and her wronger; and had we not
heard their story from all the participators and told
with Richardson's characteristic interest in the microscopy
of the human heart, it could never have possessed
our minds with that full sense of its reality which is the
experience of every reader. Out of the infinitesimally
little emerges what is great; out of the transitory
moments rise the forms that endure. It is of little
profit to discuss the question whether Richardson could
have effected his purpose in four volumes instead
of eight, or whether Browning ought to have contented
himself with ten thousand lines of verse instead of
twenty thousand. No one probably has said of either
work that it is too short, and many have uttered the
<a name="Page_256"></a>sentence of the critical Polonius&#8212;"This is too
long."
But neither <i>Clarissa</i> nor <i>The Ring and the Book</i> is
one of the Hundred Merry Tales; the purpose of each
writer is triumphantly effected; and while we wish
that the same effect could have been produced by
means less elaborate, it is not safe to assert confidently
that this was possible.</p>
<p>It has often been said that the story is told ten
times over by almost as many speakers; it would be
more correct to say that the story is not told even
once. Nine different speakers tell nine different stories,
stories of varying incidents about different persons&#8212;for
the Pompilia of Guido and the Pompilia of
Caponsacchi are as remote, each from other, as a
marsh-fire from a star, and so with the rest. In the
end we are left to invent the story for ourselves&#8212;not
indeed without sufficient guidance towards the truth
of things, since the successive speeches are a discipline
in distinguishing the several values of human
testimony. We become familiar with idols of the
cave, idols of the tribe, idols of the market-place, and
shall recognise them if we meet them again. Gossipry
on this side is checked and controlled by gossipry on
that; and the nicely balanced indifferentism of men
emasculate, blank of belief, who play with the realities
of life, is set forth with its superior foolishness of
wisdom. The advocacy which consists of professional
self-display is exhibited genially, humorously, an
advocacy horn-eyed to the truth of its own case, to
every truth, indeed, save one&#8212;that which commends
the advocate himself, his ingenious wit, and his flowers
of rhetoric. The criminal is allowed his due portion
of veracity and his fragment of truth&#8212;"What shall
<a name="Page_257"></a>a man give for his life?" He has enough truth
to enable him to fold a cloud across the light, to
wrench away the sign-posts and reverse their pointing
hands, to remove the land-marks, to set up false signal
fires upon the rocks. And then are heard three
successive voices, each of which, and each in a different
way, brings to our mind the words, "But there is a
spirit in man; and the inspiration of the Almighty
giveth them understanding." First the voice of the
pure passion of manhood, which is naked and unashamed;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">a voice terrible in its sincerity,
absolute in<br />
its abandonment to truth, prophet-like in its carelessness
of personal consequences, its carelessness of all except
the deliverance of a message&#8212;and yet withal a courtly
voice, and, if it please, ironical. It is as if Elihu the
son of Barachel stood up and his wrath were kindled:
"Behold my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it
is ready to burst like new bottles. I will speak that
I may be refreshed." And yet we dare not say that
Caponsacchi's truth is the whole truth; he speaks like
a man newly converted, still astonished by the supernatural
light, and inaccessible to many things visible
in the light of common day. Next, a voice from one
who is human indeed "to the red-ripe of the heart,"
but who is already withdrawn from all the turbulence
and turbidity of life; the voice of a woman who is
still a child; of a mother who is still virginal; of
primitive instinct, which comes from God, and spiritual
desire kindled by that saintly knighthood that had
saved her; a voice from the edge of the world, where
the dawn of another world has begun to tremble and
grow luminous,&#8212;uttering its fragment of the truth.
Last, the voice of old age, and authority and matured
<a name="Page_258"></a>experience, and divine illumination, old age
encompassed
by much doubt and weariness and human infirmity,
a solemn, pondering voice, which, with God
somewhere in the clear-obscure, goes sounding on a
dim and perilous way, until in a moment this voice of
the anxious explorer for truth changes to the voice
of the unalterable justicer, the armed doomsman of
righteousness.</span></p>
<p>Truth absolute is not attained by any one of the
speakers; that, Browning would say, is the concern of
God. And so, at the close, we are directed to take
to heart the lesson</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>That our human speech is naught,<br />
</span><span>Our human testimony false, our fame<br />
</span><span>And human estimation words and wind.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>But there are degrees of approximation to truth and
of remoteness from it. Truth as apprehended by pure
passion, truth as apprehended by simplicity of soul
("And a little child shall lead them"), truth as apprehended
by spiritual experience&#8212;such respectively make
up the substance of the monologues of Caponsacchi,
of Pompilia, and of the Pope. For the valuation,
however, of this loftier testimony we require a sense
of the level ground, even if it be the fen-country.
A perception of the heights must be given by exhibiting
the plain. If we were carried up in the air
and heard these voices how should we know for
certain that we had not become inhabitants of some
Cloudcuckootown? And the plain is where we ordinarily
live and move; it has its rights, and is worth
understanding for its own sake. Therefore we shall
mix our mind with that of "Half-Rome" and "The
Other Half-Rome" before we climb any mounts of
<a name="Page_259"></a>transfiguration or enter any city set upon a
hill. The
"man in the street" is a veritable person, and it is
good that we should make his acquaintance; even
the man in the <i>salon</i> may speak his mind if he will;
such shallow excitements, such idle curiosities as theirs
will enable us better to appreciate the upheaval to the
depths in the heart of Caponsacchi, the quietude, and
the rapt joy in quietude, of Pompilia, the profound
searchings of spirit that proceed all through the droop
of that sombre February day in the closet of the Pope.
And, then, at the most tragic moment and when
pathos is most poignant, life goes on, and the world
is wide, and laughter is not banished from earth.
Therefore Dominus Hyacinthus de Archangelis, Procurator
of the Poor, shall make his ingenious notes
for the defence of Count Guido, and cite his precedents
and quote his authorities, and darken counsel with
words, all to be by and by ecclesiasticized and
regularized and Latinized and Ciceroized, while more
than half the good man's mind is occupied with
thought of the imminent "lovesome frolic feast" on
his boy Cinone's birth-night, which shall bring with it
lamb's fry and liver, stung out of its monotony of
richness by parsley-sprigs and fennel. Yes, and we
shall hear also the other side&#8212;how, in a florilegium
of Latin, selected to honour aright the Graces and the
Muses and the majesty of Law, Johannes-Baptista
Bottinius can do justice to his client and to his own
genius by showing, with due exordium and argument
and peroration, that Pompilia is all that her worst
adversaries allege, and yet can be established innocent,
or not so very guilty, by her rhetorician's learning and
legal deftness in quart and tierce.</p>
<p><a name="Page_260"></a>The secondary personages in Richardson's
"Clarissa"
grow somewhat faint in our memories; but the figures
of his heroine and of Lovelace remain not only uneffaceable
but undimmed by time. Four of the
<i>dramatis personae</i> of Browning's poem in like manner
possess an enduring life, which shows no decline or
abatement after the effect of the monologues by the
other speakers has been produced and the speakers
themselves almost forgotten. Count Guide Franceschini
is not a miracle of evil rendered credible, like
Shakespeare's Iago, nor a strange enormity of tyrannous
hate and lust like the Count Cenci of Shelley.
He has no spirit of diabolic revelry in crime; no
feeling for its delicate artistry; he is under no spell
of fascination derived from its horror. He is clumsy
in his fraud and coarse in his violence. Sin may have
its strangeness in beauty; but Guido does not gleam
with the romance of sin. If Browning once or twice
gives his fantasy play, it is in describing the black
cave of a palace at Arezzo into which the white
Pompilia is borne, the cave and its denizens&#8212;the
"gaunt gray nightmare" of a mother, mopping and
mowing in the dusk, the brothers, "two obscure goblin
creatures, fox-faced this, cat-clawed the other," with
Guido himself as the main monster. Yet the Count,
short of stature, "hook-nosed and yellow in a bush of
beard" is not a monster but a man; possessed of
intellectual ability and a certain grace of bearing when
occasion requires; although wrenched and enfeebled
by the torture of the rack he holds his ground, has
even a little irony to spare, and makes a skilful defence.
Browning does not need a lithe, beautiful, mysterious
human panther, and is content with a plain, prosaic,
<a name="Page_261"></a>serviceable villain, who would have been
disdained
by the genius of the dramatist Webster as wanting
in romance. But like some of Webster's saturnine,
fantastic assistants or tools in crime, Guido has failed
in everything, is no longer young, chews upon the
bitter root of failure, and is half-poisoned by its acrid
juices. He is godless in an age of godless living;
cynical in a cynical generation; and ever and anon
he betrays the licentious imagination of an age of
license. He plays a poor part in the cruel farce of
life, and snarls against the world, while clinging
desperately to the world and to life. A disinterested
loyalty to the powers of evil might display a certain
gallantry of its own, but, though Guido loathes goodness,
his devotion to evil has no inverted chivalry in
it&#8212;there is always a valid reason, a sordid motive
for his rage. And in truth he has grounds of complaint,
which a wave of generous passion would have
swept away, but which, following upon the ill successes
of his life, might well make a bad man mad. His
wife, palmed off upon the representative of an ancient
and noble house, is the child of a nameless father and
a common harlot of Rome; she is repelled by his
person; and her cold submission to what she has
been instructed in by the Archbishop as the duties
of a wife is more intolerable than her earlier remoter
aversion. He is cheated of the dowry which lured
him to marriage. He is pointed at with smiling scorn
by the gossips of Arezzo. A gallant of the troop of
Satan might have devised and executed some splendid
revenge; but Guido is ever among the sutlers and
camp-followers of the fiend, who are base before they
are bold. When he makes his final pleading for life
<a name="Page_262"></a>in the cell of the New Prison by Castle Angelo,
the
animal cry, like that of a wild cat on whom the teeth of
the trap have closed, is rendered shrill by the intensity
of imagination with which he pictures to himself the
apparatus of the scaffold and the hideous circumstance
of his death. His effort, as far as it is rational, is to
transfer the guilt of his deeds to anyone or everyone
but himself. When all other resources fail he boldly
lays the offence upon God, who has made him what
he is. It was a fine audacity of Browning in imagining
the last desperate shriek of the wretched man, uttered
as the black-hatted Brotherhood of Death descend the
stairs singing their accursed psalm, to carry the
climax of appeal to the powers of charity, "Christ,&#8212;Maria,&#8212;God,"
one degree farther, and make the
murderer last of all cry upon his victim to be his
saviour from the death which he dares to name by
the name of his own crime, a name which that crime
might seem to have sequestered from all other uses:&#8212;</p>
<p>"Pompilia, will you let them murder me?"</p>
<p>Pompilia is conceived by Browning not as a pale,
passive victim, but as strong with a vivid, interior
life, and not more perfect in patience than in her
obedience to the higher law which summons her to
resistance to evil and championship of the right.
Her purity is not the purity of ice but of fire. When
the Pope would find for himself a symbol to body
forth her soul, it is not a lily that he thinks of but
a rose. Others may yield to the eye of God a "timid
leaf" and an "uncertain bud,"</p>

<p>As she lies on her pallet, dying "in the good house

</div>
<p>Two possessions, out of what life has brought,
remain with her&#8212;the babe, who while yet unborn
had converted her from a sufferer to a defender, and
the friend who has saved her soul. Even motherhood
itself is not the deepest thing in Pompilia's nature.
The little Gaetano, whom she had held in her arms
for three days, will change; he will grow great, strong,
stern, a tall young man, who cannot guess what she
was like, who may some day have some hard thought
of her. He too withdraws into the dream of earth.
She can never lose him, and yet lose him she surely
must; all she can do is by dying to give him "out-right
to God, without a further care," so to be safe.
But one experience of Pompilia's life was quite out
of time, and belongs by its mere essence to eternity.
Having laid her babe away with God, she must not
even "think of him again, for gratitude"; and her
last breath shall spend itself in doing service to earth by
striving to make men know aright what earth will for a
time possess and then, forever, heaven&#8212;God's servant,
man's friend, the saviour of the weak, the foe of all who
are vile&#8212;and to the gossips of Arezzo and of Rome the
fribble and coxcomb and light-of-love priest, Caponsacchi.</p>
<p><a name="Page_264"></a>If any point in the whole long poem, <i>The
Ring and
the Book</i>, can be described as central, it must be found
in the relations, each to the other, of Caponsacchi and
Pompilia. The truth of it, as conceived by Browning,
could hardly be told otherwise than in poetry, for it
needs the faith that comes through spiritual beauty to
render it comprehensible and credible, and such beauty
is best expressed by art. It is easy to convince the
world of a passion between the sexes which is simply
animal; nor is art much needed to help out the proof.
Happily the human love, in which body and soul play
in varying degrees their parts, and each an honoured
part, is in widest commonalty spread. But the love
that is wholly spiritual seems to some a supernatural
thing, and if it be not discredited as utterly unreal
(which at certain periods, if literature be a test, has
been the case), it is apt to appear as a thing phantom-like,
tenuous, and cold. But, in truth, this reality
once experienced makes the other realities appear the
shadows, and it is an ardour as passionate as any that
is known to man. Its special note is a deliverance from
self with a joy in abandonment to some thing other
than self, like that which has been often recorded as
an experience in religious conversion; when Bunyan,
for example, ceased from the efforts to establish his
own righteousness and saw that righteousness above
him in the eternal heavens, he walked as a man
suddenly illuminated, and could hardly forbear telling
his joy to the crows upon the plough-land; and so,
in its degree, with the spiritual exaltation produced by
the love of man and woman when it touches a certain
rare but real altitude. If a poet can succeed in lifting
up our hearts so that they may know for actual the
<a name="Page_265"></a>truth of these things, he has contributed an
important
fragment towards an interpretation of human life.
And this Browning has assuredly done. The sense
of a power outside oneself whose influence invades the
just-awakened man, the conviction that the secret of
life has been revealed, the lying passive and prone to
the influx of the spirit, the illumination, the joy, the
assurance that old things have passed away and that
all things have become new, the acceptance of a
supreme law, the belief in a victory obtained over time
and death, the rapture in a heart prepared for all self-sacrifice,
entire immolation&#8212;these are rendered by
Browning with a fidelity which if reached solely by
imagination is indeed surprising, for who can discover
these mysteries except through a personal experience?<a
 name="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a>
If the senses co-operate&#8212;as perhaps they do&#8212;in such
mysteries, they are senses in a state of transfiguration,
senses taken up into the spirit&#8212;"Whether in the body
or out of the body I cannot tell." When Caponsacchi
bears the body of Pompilia in a swoon to her chamber
in the inn at Castelnuovo, it is as if he bore the host.
From the first moment when he set eyes upon her
in the theatre,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>A lady, young, tall, beautiful, strange and
sad,<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>he is delivered from his frivolous self, he is solemnized
and awed; the form of his worship is self-sacrifice;
his first word to her&#8212;"I am yours "&#8212;is</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>An eternity<br />
</span><span>Of speech, to match the immeasurable depth<br />
</span><span>O' the soul that then broke silence.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_266"></a>To abstain from ever seeing her again would
be joy
more than pain if this were duty to her and to God.
For him the mere revelation of Pompilia would suffice.
His inmost feeling is summed up with perfect adequacy
in a word to the Judges: "You know this is not love,
Sirs&#8212;it is faith."</p>
<p>There is another kind of faith which comes not
suddenly through passion but slowly through thought
and action and trial, and the long fidelity of a life. It
is that of which Milton speaks in the lines:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Till old experience do attain<br />
</span><span>To something of Prophetic strain.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>This is the faith of Browning's Pope Innocent, who up
to extreme old age has kept open his intelligence both
on the earthward and the Godward sides, and who,
being wholly delivered from self by that devotion to
duty which is the habit of his mind, can apprehend the
truth of things and pronounce judgment upon them
almost with the certitude of an instrument of the divine
righteousness. And yet he is entirely human, God's
vicegerent and also an old man, learned in the secrets
of the heart, patient in the inquisition of facts, weighing
his documents, scrutinising each fragment of
evidence, burdened by the sense of responsibility,
cheered also by the opportunity of true service,
grave but not sad&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Simple, sagacious, mild yet resolute,<br />
</span><span>With prudence, probity and&#8212;what beside<br />
</span><span>From the other world he feels impress at times;<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>a "grey ultimate decrepitude," yet visited by the
spiritual fire which touches a soul whose robe of
flesh is worn thin; not unassailed by doubts as to
<a name="Page_267"></a>the justice of his final decision, but assured
that his
part is confidently to make the best use of the powers
with which he has been entrusted; young of heart, if
also old, in his rejoicing in goodness and his antipathy
to evil.</p>
<p><i>The Ring and the Book</i> is a great receptacle into
which Browning poured, with an affluence that perhaps
is excessive, all his powers&#8212;his searchings for truth,
his passion, his casuistry, his feeling for beauty, his
tenderness, his gift of pity, his veiled memories of
what was most precious in the past, his hopes for the
future, his worldly knowledge, his unworldly aspirations,
his humour, such as it was, robust rather than delicate.
Could the three monologues which tell how in various
ways it strikes a Roman contemporary have been fused
into a single dialogue, could the speeches of the two
advocates have been briefly set over, one against the
other, instead of being drawn out at length, we might
still have got the whole of Browning's mind. But we
must take things as we find them, and perhaps a
skilled writer knows his own business best. Never
was Browning's mastery in narrative displayed with
such effect as in Caponsacchi's account of the flight to
Rome, which is not mere record, but record winged
with lyrical enthusiasm. Never was his tenderness so
deep or poignant as in his realisation of the motherhood
of Pompilia. Never were the gropings of
intellect and the intuitions of the spirit shown by him
in their weakness and their strength with such a lucid
subtlety as in the deliberations and decisions of the
Pope. The whole poem which he compares to a ring
was the ring of a strong male finger; but the posy of
the ring, and the comparison is again his own, tells
<a name="Page_268"></a>how it was a gift hammered and filed during the
years of smithcraft "in memoriam"; in memory and
also with a hope.</p>
<p>The British Public, whom Browning addresses at
the close of his poem, and who "liked him not" during
so many years, now when he was not far from sixty
went over to his side. <i>The Ring and the Book</i> almost
immediately passed into a second edition. The decade
from 1869 onwards is called by Mrs Orr the fullest
period in Browning's life. His social occupations and
entertainments both in London and for a time as a
visitor at country-houses became more numerous and
absorbing, yet he had energy for work as well as for
play. During these ten years no fewer than nine new
volumes of his poetry appeared. None of them are
London poems, and Italy is for the present almost
forgotten; it is the scene of only two or three short
pieces, which are included in the volume of 1876&#8212;<i>Pacchiarotto
and how he worked in distemper; with
other Poems</i>. The other pieces of the decade as
regards their origin fall with a single exception into
two groups; first those of ancient Greece, suggested
by Browning's studies in classical drama; secondly
those, which in a greater or less degree, are connected
with his summer wanderings in France and Switzerland.
The dream-scene of Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau is
Leicester Square; but this also is one of the poems
of France. <i>The Inn Album</i> alone is English in its
characters and their surroundings. Such a grouping
of the works of the period is of a superficial nature,
and it can be readily dismissed. It brings into
prominence, however, the fact that Browning, while
resolved to work out what was in him, lay open to
<a name="Page_269"></a>casual suggestions. He had acquired certain
methods
which he could apply to almost any topic. He had
confidence that any subject on which he concentrated
his powers of mind could be compelled to yield
material of interest. It cannot be said that he
exercised always a wise discretion in the choice of
subjects; these ought to have been excellent in themselves;
he trusted too much to the successful issue of
the play of his own intellect and imagination around
and about his subjects. <i>The Ring and the Book</i> had
given him practice, extending over several years, in
handling the large dramatic monologue. Now he
was prepared to stretch the dramatic monologue
beyond the bounds, and new devices were invented
to keep it from stagnating and to carry it forward.
Imaginary disputants intervene in the monologue;
there are objections, replies, retorts; a second player
in the game not being found, the speaker has to play
against himself.</p>
<p>In the story of the Roman murder-case fancy was
mingled with fact, and truth with falsehood, with a
view to making truth in the end the more salient.
The poet had used to the full his dramatic right of
throwing himself into intellectual sympathy with
persons towards whom he stood in moral antagonism
or at least experienced an inward sense of alienation.
The characteristic of much of his later poetry is that it
is for ever tasking falsehood to yield up truth, for ever
(to employ imagery of his own) as a swimmer beating
the treacherous water with the feet in order that the
head may rise higher into the pure air made for the
spirit's breathing. Browning's genius united an intellect
which delighted in the investigation of complex
<a name="Page_270"></a>problems with a spiritual and emotional nature
manifesting
itself in swift and simple solutions of those
problems; it united an analytic or discursive power
supplied by the head with an intuitive power springing
from the heart. He employed his brain to twist and
tangle a Gordian knot in order that in a moment it
might be cut with the sword of the spirit. In the
earlier poems his spiritual ardours and intuitions were
often present throughout, and without latency, without
reserve; impassioned truth often flashed upon the
reader through no intervening or resisting medium.
In <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, and in a far greater degree
in some subsequent poems, while the supreme authority
resides in the spiritual intuitions or the passions of the
heart, their instantaneous, decisive work waits until
a prolonged casuistry has accomplished its utmost;
falsehood seems almost more needful in the process of
the poet than truth. And yet it is never actually so.
Rather to the poet, as a moral explorer, it appeared a
kind of cowardice to seek truth only where it may
easily be found; the strenuous hunter will track it
through all winding ways of error; it is thrown out as
a spot of intense illumination upon a background of
darkness; it leaps forth as the flash of the search-light
piercing through a mist. The masculine
characters in the poems are commonly made the
exponents of Browning's intellectual casuistry&#8212;a
Hohenstiel-Schwangau, an Aristophanes; and they
are made to say the best and the most truthful words
that can be uttered by such as they are and from
such positions as theirs; the female characters, a
Balaustion, the Lady of Sorrows in <i>The Inn Album</i>,
and others are often revealers of sudden truth, which
<a name="Page_271"></a>with them is either a divine revelation&#8212;the
vision
seen from a higher and clearer standpoint&#8212;or a
dictate of pure human passion. Eminent moments in
life had an extraordinary interest for Browning&#8212;moments
when life, caught up out of the habitual
ways and the lower levels of prudence, takes its
guidance and inspiring motive from an immediate
discovery of truth through some noble ardour of the
heart. Therefore it did not seem much to him to
task his ingenuity through almost all the pages of a
laborious book in creating a tangle and embroilment
of evil and good, of truth and falsehood, in view of
the fact that a shining moment is at last to spring
forward and do its work of severing absolutely and
finally right from wrong, and shame from a splendour
of righteousness. Browning's readers longed at times,
and not without cause, for the old directness and the
old pervading presence of spiritual and impassioned
truth.<a name="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<br />
<p>During these years, 1869-1878, Browning's outward
life maintained its accustomed ways. In the summer
of 1869 he wandered with his son and his sister, in
company with his friends of Italian days, the Storys,
in Scotland, and at Lock Luichart Lodge visited Lady
Ashburton.<a name="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a>
Three summers, those of 1870, 1872
and 1873 were spent at Saint-Aubin, a wild "un-Murrayed"
village on the coast of Normandy, where
Milsand occupied a little cottage hard by. At night
the light-house of Havre shot forth its beam, and it
was with "a thrill" that Browning saw far off the spot
where he had once sojourned with his wife.<a name="FNanchor_104"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> "I don't
think we were ever quite so thoroughly washed by the
sea-air from all quarters as here," he wrote in August
1870. Every morning, as Mme. Blanc (Th. Bentzon)
tells us, he might be seen "walking along the sands
with the small Greek copy of Homer which was his
constant companion. On Sunday he went with the
Milsands ... to a service held in the chapel of the
Chateau Blagny, at Lion-sur-Mer, for the few Protestants
of that region. They were generally accom<a name="Page_273"></a>panied
by a young Huguenot peasant, their neighbour,
and Browning with the courtesy he showed to every
woman, used to take a little bag from the hands of
the strong Norman girl, notwithstanding her entreaties."
The visit of 1870 was saddened by the knowledge of
what France was suffering during the progress of the
war. He lingered as long as possible for the sake of
comradeship with Milsand, around whose shoulder
Browning's arm would often lie as they walked
together on the beach.<a name="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a>
But communication with
England became daily more and more difficult.
Milsand insisted that his friend should instantly
return. It is said by Mme. Blanc that Browning was
actually suspected by the peasants of a neighbouring
village of being a Prussian spy. Not without difficulty
he and his sister reached Honfleur, where an English
cattle-boat was found preparing to start at midnight
for Southampton.</p>
<p>Two years later Miss Thackeray was also on the
coast of Normandy and at no great distance. "It was
a fine hot summer," she writes, "with sweetness and
completeness everywhere; the cornfields gilt and far-stretching,
the waters blue, the skies arching high
and clear, and the sunsets succeeding each other in
most glorious light and beauty." Some slight misunderstanding
on Browning's part, the fruit of mischief-making
gossipry, which caused constraint between
him and his old friend was cleared away by the good
offices of Milsand. While Miss Thackeray sat writing,
with shutters closed against the blazing sun, Browning
himself "dressed all in white, with a big white umbrella
<a name="Page_274"></a>under his arm," arrived to take her hand with
all his
old cordiality. A meeting of both with the Milsands,
then occupying a tiny house in a village on the outer
edges of Luc-sur-mer, soon followed, and before the
sun had fallen that evening they were in Browning's
house upon the cliff at Saint-Aubin. "The sitting-room
door opened to the garden and the sea beyond&#8212;fresh-swept
bare floor, a table, three straw chairs, one
book upon the table. Mr Browning told us it was
the only book he had with him. The bedrooms were
as bare as the sitting-room, but I remember a little
dumb piano standing in a corner, on which he used to
practise in the early morning. I heard Mr Browning
declare they were perfectly satisfied with their little
house; that his brains, squeezed as dry as a sponge,
were only ready for fresh air."<a name="FNanchor_106"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> Perhaps Browning's
"only book" of 1872 contained the dramas of
&AElig;schylus, for at Fontainebleau where he spent some
later weeks of the year these were the special subject
of his study. It was at Saint-Aubin in 1872 that he
found the materials for his poem of the following year,
and to Miss Thackeray's drowsy name for the district,</p>

</div>
<p><i>White Cotton Night-Cap Country</i>, the suggestion of
Browning's title <i>Red Cotton Night-Cap Country</i> is due.
To her the poem is dedicated.</p>
<p>Browning's interest in those who were rendered
homeless and destitute in France during the Prussian
invasion was shown in a practical way in the spring
of 1871. He had for long been averse to the publication
of his poems in magazines and reviews. In 1864
<a name="Page_275"></a>he had gratified his American admirers by
allowing
<i>Gold Hair</i> and <i>Prospice</i> to appear in the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i> previous to their inclusion in <i>Dramatis
Persona.</i> A fine sonnet written in 1870, suggested
by the tower erected at Clandeboye by Lord Dufferin
in memory of his mother, Helen, Countess of Gifford,
had been inserted in some undistributed copies of a
pamphlet, "Helen's Tower," privately printed twenty
years previously; the sonnet was published at the
close of 1883 in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, but was
not given a place by Browning in the collected editions
of his Poetical Works. In general he felt that the
miscellaneous contents of a magazine, surrounding a
poem, formed hardly an appropriate setting for such
verse as his. In February 1871, however, he offered
to his friend and, publisher Mr Smith the ballad of
<i>Herv&eacute; Riel</i> for use in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> of
March,
venturing for once, as he says, to puff his wares and
call the verses good. His purpose was to send something
to the distressed people of Paris, and one
hundred guineas, the sum liberally fixed by Mr
Smith as the price of the poem, were duly forwarded&#8212;the
gift of the English poet and his Breton hero.
The facts of the story had been forgotten and were
denied at St Malo; the reports of the French Admiralty
were examined and indicated the substantial
accuracy of the poem. On one point Browning
erred; it was not a day's holiday to be spent with his
wife "la Belle Aurore" which the Breton sailor
petitioned for as the reward of his service, but a "cong&eacute;
absolu," the holiday of a life-time. In acknowledging
his error to Dr Furnivall, and adding an explanation
of its cause, he dismissed the subject with the word,
"<a name="Page_276"></a>Truth above all things; so treat the matter as
you
please."<a name="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>
<p>For the purposes of holiday-making the resources of
the northern French coast, with which Browning's ballad
of the Croisickese pilot is associated, were, says Mrs
Orr, becoming exhausted. Yet some rest and refreshment
after the heavy tax upon his strength made by
a London season with its various claims were essential
to his well-being. His passion for music would not
permit him during his residence in town to be absent
from a single important concert; the extraordinary
range of his acquaintance with the works of great and
even of obscure composers was attested by Halle. In
his sonnet of 1884, inscribed in the Album to Mr
Arthur Chappell, <i>The Founder of the Feast</i>, a poem
not included in any edition of his works, he recalls
these evenings of delight:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Sense has received the utmost Nature grants,<br />
</span><span>My cup was filled with rapture to the brim,<br />
</span><span>When, night by night&#8212;ah, memory, how it haunts!&#8212;<br />
</span><span>Music was poured by perfect ministrants,<br />
</span><span>By Halle, Schumann, Piatti, Joachim.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Long since in Florence he had become acquainted
with Miss Egerton-Smith, who loved music like himself,
and was now often his companion at public
performances in London. She was wealthy, and with
too little confidence in her power to win the regard of
others, she lived apart from the great world. In 1872
Browning lost the warm-hearted and faithful friend
who had given him such prompt, womanly help in his
worst days of grief&#8212;Miss Blagden. Her place in his
<a name="Page_277"></a>memory remained her own. Miss Egerton-Smith
might seem to others wanting in strength of feeling
and cordiality of manner. Browning knew the sensitiveness
of her nature, which responded to the touch of
affection, and he could not fail to discover her true
self, veiled though it was by a superficial reserve. And
as he knew her, so he wrote of her in the opening of
his <i>La Saisiaz</i>:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>You supposed that few or none had known and
loved you in the world:<br />
</span><span>May be! flower that's full-blown tempts the butterfly, not
flower that's furled.<br />
</span><span>But more learned sense unlocked you, loosed the sheath and
let expand<br />
</span><span>Bud to bell and out-spread flower-shape at the least warm
touch of hand<br />
</span><span>&#8212;Maybe throb of heart, beneath which,&#8212;quickening farther
than it knew,&#8212;<br />
</span><span>Treasure oft was disembosomed, scent all strange and
unguessed hue.<br />
</span><span>Disembosomed, re-embosomed,&#8212;must one memory suffice,<br />
</span><span>Prove I knew an Alpine rose which all beside named
Edelweiss?<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Miss Egerton-Smith was the companion and house-mate
of Browning and his sister in their various
summer wanderings from 1874 to 1877. In the
first of these years the three friends occupied a house
facing the sea at the village of Mers near Tr&eacute;port.
Browning at this time was much absorbed by his
<i>Aristophanes' Apology</i>. "Here," writes Mrs Orr, "with
uninterrupted quiet, and in a room devoted to his
use, Mr Browning would work till the afternoon was
advanced, and then set off on a long walk over the
cliffs, often in the face of a wind, which, as he wrote
of it at the time, he could lean against as if it were a
<a name="Page_278"></a>wall." The following summers were spent at
Villers
in Normandy (1875), at the Isle of Arran (1876), and
in the upland country of the Sal&egrave;ve, near Geneva.
During the visit to the Sal&egrave;ve district, where Browning
and his sister with Miss Egerton-Smith occupied a
chalet named La Saisiaz, he was, Mrs Orr tells us,
"unusually depressed and unusually disposed to regard
the absence from home as a banishment." Yet the
place seemed lovely to him in its solitude and its
beauty; the prospect of Geneva, with lake and plain
extended below, varying in appearance with the shifting
of clouds, was repose to his sense of sight. He
bathed twice each day in the mountain stream&#8212;"a
marvel of delicate delight framed in with trees." He
read and rested; and wrote but little or not at all.
Suddenly the repose of La Saisiaz was broken up;
the mood of languorous pleasure and drowsy discontent
was at an end. While preparing to join her
friend on a long-intended mountain climb Miss
Egerton-Smith, with no forewarning, died. The
shock was for a time overwhelming. When Browning
returned to London the poem <i>La Saisiaz</i>, the record
of his inquisition into the mystery of death, of his
inward debate concerning a future life, was written.
It was the effort of resilience in his spirit in opposition
to that stroke which deprived him of the friend
who was so near and dear.</p>
<p>The grouping of the works produced by Browning
from the date of the publication of <i>The Ring and the
Book</i> (1868) to the publication of <i>La Saisias</i> (1878),
which is founded upon the occasions that suggested
them, has only an external and historical interest.
The studies in the Greek drama and the creations to
<a name="Page_279"></a>which these gave rise extend at intervals over
the
whole decade. <i>Balaustion's Adventure</i> was published
in 1871, <i>Aristophanes' Apology</i> in 1875, the translation
of <i>The Agamemnon of &AElig;schylus</i> in 1877. Two of the
volumes of this period, <i>Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau</i>
(1871) and <i>Fifine at the Fair</i> (1872) are casuistical
monologues, and these, it will be observed, lie side by
side in the chronological order. The first of the pair
is concerned with public and political life, with the
conduct and character of a man engaged in the affairs
of state; the second, with a domestic question, the
casuistry of wedded fidelity and infidelity, from which
the scope of the poem extends itself to a wider survey
of human existence and its meanings.<a name="FNanchor_108"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> Two of the
volumes are narrative poems, each tending to a tragic
crisis; <i>Red Cotton Night-Cap Country</i> (1873) is a story
entangled with questions relating to religion; <i>The Inn
Album</i> (1875) is a tragedy of the passion of love.
The volume of 1876, <i>Pacchiarotto with other Poems</i>, is
the miscellaneous gathering of lyrical and narrative
pieces which had come into being during a period of
many years. Finally in <i>La Saisiaz</i> Browning, writing
in his own person, records the experience of his spirit
in confronting the problem of death. But it was part
of his creed that the gladness of life may take hands
with its grief, that the poet who would live mightily
must live joyously; and in the volume which contained
his poem of strenuous and virile sorrow he did not
refrain from including a second piece, <i>The two Poets of
Croisic</i>, which has in it much matter of honest mirth,
and closes with the declaration that the test of great<a name="Page_280"></a>ness
in an artist lies in his power of converting his
more than common sufferings into a more than
common joy.</p>
<p><i>Balaustion's Adventure</i>, dedicated to the Countess
Cowper by whom the transcript from Euripides was
suggested, or, as Browning will have it, prescribed,
proved, as the dedication declares, "the most delightful
of May-month amusements" in the spring of 1871.
It was the happiest of thoughts to give the version of
Euripides' play that setting which has for its source
a passage at the close of Plutarch's life of Nicias.
The favours bestowed by the Syracusans upon
Athenian slaves and fugitives who could delight them
by reciting or singing the verses of Euripides is not
to be marvelled at, says Plutarch, "weying a reporte
made of a ship of the city of Caunus, that on a time
being chased thether by pyrates, thinking to save
themselves within their portes, could not at the first
be received, but had repulse: howbeit being demaunded
whether they could sing any of Euripides songes, and
aunswering that they could, were straight suffered to
enter, and come in."<a name="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a>
From this root blossomed
Browning's romance of the Rhodian girl, who saves
her country folk and wins a lover and a husband by
her delight in the poetry of one who was more highly
honoured abroad than in his own Athens. Perhaps
Browning felt that an ardent girl would be the best
interpreter of the womanly heroism and the pathos of
"that strangest, saddest, sweetest song," of Euripides.
Of all its author's dramas the Alkestis is the most
appropriate to the occasion, for it is the poem of a
great deliverance from death, and here in effect it
<a name="Page_281"></a>delivers from death, or worse, the fugitives
from the
pirate-bark, "at destruction's very edge," who are the
suppliants to Syracuse. In accepting the task imposed
upon him Browning must have felt that no
other play of Euripides could so entirely have borne
out the justice of the characterisation of the poet by
Mrs Browning in the lines which he prefixed to
<i>Balaustions Adventure</i>:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Our Euripides the human,<br />
</span><span>With his droppings of warm tears.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>"If the Alkestis is not the masterpiece of the genius
of Euripides," wrote Paul de Saint-Victor, "it is perhaps
the masterpiece of his heart."<a name="FNanchor_110"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>
<p>Balaustion herself, not a rose of "the Rosy Isle"
but its wild-pomegranate-flower, since amid the verdure
of the tree "you shall find food, drink, odour all at
once," is Hellenic in her bright and swift intelligence,
her enthusiasm for all noble things of the mind, the
grace of every movement of her spirit, her culture and
her beauty. The atmosphere of the poem, which
encircles the translation, is singularly luminous and
animating; the narrative of the adventure is rapid yet
always lucid; the verse leaps buoyantly like a wave
of the sea. Balaustion tells her tale to the four Greek
girls, her companions, amid the free things of nature,
the overhanging grape vines, the rippling stream,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Outsmoothing galingale and watermint,<br />
</span><span>Its mat-floor,<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>and in presence of the little temple Baccheion, with its
sanctities of religion and of art. By a happy and
original device the transcript of the Alkestis is much
<a name="Page_282"></a>more than a translation; it is a translation
rendered
into dramatic action&#8212;for we see and hear the performers
and they are no longer masked&#8212;and this is
accompanied with a commentary or an interpretation.
Never was a more graceful apology for the function
of the critic put forward than that of Balaustion:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>'Tis the poet speaks:<br />
</span><span>But if I, too, should try and speak at times,<br />
</span><span>Leading your love to where my love, perchance,<br />
</span><span>Climbed earlier, found a nest before you knew&#8212;<br />
</span><span>Why, bear with the poor climber, for love's sake!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Browning has not often played the part of a critic,
and the interpretation of a poet's work by a poet has
the double value of throwing light upon the mind of
the original writer and the mind of his commentator.</p>
<p>The life of mortals and the life of the immortal
gods are brought into a beautiful relation throughout
the play. It is pre-eminently human in its grief and
in its joy; yet at every point the divine care, the
divine help surrounds and supports the children of
earth, with their transitory tears and smiles. Apollo
has been a herdsman in the service of Admetos;
Herakles, most human of demigods, is the king's friend
and guest. The interest of the play for Browning
lay especially in three things&#8212;the pure self-sacrifice
of the heroine, devotion embodied in one supreme
deed; and no one can heighten the effect with which
Euripides has rendered this; secondly, the joyous,
beneficent strength of Herakles, and this Browning has
felt in a peculiar degree, and by his commentary has
placed it in higher relief; and thirdly, the purification
and elevation through suffering of the character of
Admetos; here it would be rash to assert that
<a name="Page_283"></a>Browning has not divined the intention of
Euripides,
but certainly he has added something of his own.
It has been maintained that Browning's interpretation
of the spiritual significance of the drama is a beautiful
perversion of the purpose of the Greek poet; that
Admetos needs no purification; that in accepting his
wife's offer to be his substitute in dying, the king
was no craven but a king who recognised duty to the
state as his highest duty. The general feeling of readers
of the play does not fall in with this ingenious plea.
Browning, as appears from his imagined recast of the
theme, which follows the transcript, had considered
and rejected it. If Admetos is to be in some degree
justified, it can only be by bearing in mind that the
fact by which he shall himself escape from death is
of Apollo's institution, and that obedience to the
purpose of Apollo rendered self-preservation a kind
of virtue. But Admetos makes no such defence of
his action when replying to the reproaches of his
father, and he anticipates that the verdict of the world
will be against him. Browning undoubtedly presses
the case against Admetos far more strongly than does
Euripides, who seems to hold that a man weak in one
respect, weak when brought to face the test of death,
may yet be strong in the heroic mastery of grief
which is imposed upon him by the duties of hospitality.
Readers of the Winter's Tale have sometimes
wondered whether there could be much rapture of
joy in the heart of the silent Hermione when she
received back her unworthy husband. If Admetos
remained at the close of the play what he is understood
by Browning to have been at its opening, reunion
with a self-lover so base could hardly have flushed
<a name="Page_284"></a>with gladness the spirit of Alkestis just
escaped from
the shades.<a name="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a>
But Alkestis, who had proved her own
loyalty by deeds, values deeds more than words.
When dying she had put her love into an act, and
had refrained from mere words of wifely tenderness;
death put an end to her services to her husband; she
felt towards him as any wife, if Browning's earlier
poem be true, may feel to any husband; but still she
could render a service to her children, and she exacts
from Admetos the promise that he will never place
a stepmother over them. His allegiance to this vow
is an act, and it shall be for Alkestis the test of his
entire loyalty. And the good Herakles, who enjoys
a glorious jest amazingly, and who by that jest can
benevolently retort upon Admetos for his concealment of
Alkestis' death&#8212;for now the position is reversed and the
king shall receive her living, and yet believe her dead&#8212;Herakles
contrives to put Admetos to that precise
test which is alone sufficient to assure Alkestis of his
fidelity. Words are words; but here is a deed, and
Admetos not only adheres to his pledge, but demonstrates
to her that for him to violate it is impossible.
She may well accept him as at length proved to be
her very own.</p>
<p>Browning, who delights to show how good is
brought out of evil, or what appears such to mortal
<a name="Page_285"></a>eyes, is not content with this. He must trace
the
whole process of the purification of the soul of Admetos,
by sorrow and its cruel yet beneficent reality, and in
his commentary he emphasises each point of development
in that process. When his wife lies at the
point of death the sorrow of Admetos is not insincere,
but there was a childishness in it, for he would not
confront the fact that the event was of his own election.
Presently she has departed, and he begins to taste
the truth, to distinguish between a sorrow rehearsed
in fancy and endured in fact. In greeting Herakles
he rises to a manlier strain, puts tears away, and
accepts the realities of life and death; he will not add
ill to ill, as the sentimentalist does, but will be just
to the rights of earth that remain; he catches some
genuine strength from the magnanimous presence of
the hero-god. He renders duty to the dead; is quieted;
and enters more and more into the sternness of his
solitary wayfaring. In dealing with the ignoble wrangle
with old Pheres the critic is hard set; but Balaustion,
speaking as interpreter for Browning, explains that for
a little the king lapses back from the firmer foothold
which he had attained. Perhaps it would have been
wiser to admit that Euripides has marred his own work
by this grim tragic-comic encounter of crabbed age and
youth. But it is true that one who has much to give,
like Alkestis, gives freely; and one who has little to
give, like Pheres, clutches that little desperately and is
starved not only in possessions but in soul. For
Browning the significance of the scene lies in the idea,
which if not just is ingenious, that the encounter with
Pheres has an educational value for Admetos; he detests
his father because he sees in him an image of his own
<a name="Page_286"></a>egoism, and thus he learns more profoundly to
hate
his baser self. When the body of Alkestis has been
borne away and the king re-enters his desolate halls
the full truth breaks in upon him; nothing can be as
it has been before&#8212;"He stared at the impossible mad
life"; he has learnt that life, which yet shall be
rightly lived, is a harder thing than death:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>He was beginning to be like his wife.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>And those around him felt that having descended in
grief so far to the truth of things, he could not but
return to the light an altered and a better man.
Instructed so deeply in the realities of sorrow, Admetos
is at last made worthy to receive the blessed realities
of joy with the words,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>When I betray her, though she is no more,<br />
</span><span>May I die.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The regeneration of Admetos is accomplished. How
much in all this exposition is derived from the play,
how much is added to it, may be left for the consideration
of the reader who will compare the original
with the transcript.</p>
<p>If the character of Admetos is somewhat lowered
by Browning beneath the conception of the Greek
dramatist, to allow room for its subsequent elevation,
the conception of Herakles is certainly heightened.
We shall not say that Balaustion is the speaker and that
Herakles is somewhat of a woman's hero. Browning
himself fully enters into Balaustion's enthusiasm. And
the presence of the strong, joyous helper of men is in
truth an inspiring one. The great voice that goes
before him is itself a <i>Sursum corda!</i>&#8212;a challenge and
a summons to whatever manliness is in us. And the
<a name="Page_287"></a>best of it is that sauntering the pavement or
crossing
the ferry we may happen to encounter this face of
Herakles:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Out of this face emerge banners and horses&#8212;O
superb! I see what is coming;<br />
</span><span>I see the high pioneer-caps&#8212;I see the slaves of runners
clearing the way,<br />
</span><span>I hear victorious drums.<br />
</span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span>This face is a life-boat.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>For Walt Whitman too had seen Brother Jonathan
Herakles, and indeed the face of the strong and tender
wound-dresser was itself as the face of a calmer
Herakles to many about to die. The speeches of the
demigod in Browning's transcript require an abundant
commentary, but it is the commentary of an irrepressible
joy, an outbreak of enthusiasm which will
not be controlled. The glorious Gargantuan creature,
in the best sense Rabelaisian, is uplifted by Browning
into a very saint of joyous effort; no pallid ascetic,
indeed, beating his breast with the stone, but a
Christian saint of Luther's school, while at the same
time a somewhat over-boisterous benevolent Paynim
giant:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Gladness be with thee, Helper of our world!<br />
</span><span>I think this is the authentic sign and sea!<br />
</span><span>Of Godship, that it ever waxes glad,<br />
</span><span>And more glad, until gladness blossoms, bursts<br />
</span><span>Into a rage to suffer for mankind,<br />
</span><span>And recommence at sorrow.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Something of the Herakles ideal appears again and again
in other poems of Browning. His Breton sailor, Herv&eacute;
Riel, has more than a touch of the Heraclean frankness
of gaiety in arduous effort. His Iv&agrave;n Iv&agrave;novitch
<a name="Page_288"></a>wields the axe and abolishes a life with the
Heraclean
joy in righteousness. And in the last of Browning's
poems, not without a pathetically over-boisterous effort
and strain, there is the suggestion of an ideal conception
of himself as a Herakles-Browning; the old man
tries at least to send his great voice before him.</p>
<p>The new Admetos, new Alkestis, imagined by
Balaustion at the close of the poem, are wedded
lovers who, like the married in Pompilia's dream of
heaven, "know themselves into one." For them the
severance of death has become an impossible thing;
and therefore no place is left for Herakles in this
treatment of the story. It expresses Browning's
highest conception of the union of soul with soul:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Therewith her whole soul entered into his,<br />
</span><span>He looked the look back, and Alkestis died&#8212;<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>died only to be rejected by Hades, as still living, and
with a more potent life, in her husband's heart and
will. Yet the mortal cloud is round these mortals
still; they cannot see things as the gods see. And,
for all their hopes and endeavours, the earth which
they would renew and make as heaven, remains the
old incredulous, unconverted earth,&#8212;"Such is the envy
Gods still bear mankind." And in such an earth, if
not for them, assuredly for others, Herakles may find
great deeds to do.</p>
<p>Balaustion has the unique distinction of being
heroine throughout two of Browning's poems; and of
both we may say that the genius of Euripides is the
hero. <i>Aristophanes' Apology</i> is written from first to
last with unflagging energy; the translation of the
"Herakles" which it includes is a masculine and
<a name="Page_289"></a>masterly effort to transport the whole sense and
spirit
of the original into English verse, and the rendering
of the choral passages into lyric form gives it an
advantage over the transcript of the "Alkestis."
Perhaps not a little of the self-defence of Aristophanes
and his statement of the case against Euripides could
have been put as well or better in a critical essay in
prose; but the method of Browning enables him to
mingle, in a dramatic fashion, truth with sophistry,
and to make both serve his purpose of presenting not
only the case but the character of the great Greek
maker of comedy. Balaustion is no longer the ardent
girl of the days of her first adventure; she is a wife,
with the dignity, the authority of womanhood and
wifehood; she has known the life of Athens with its
evil and its good; she has been the favoured friend of
Euripides; she is capable of confronting his powerful
rival in popular favour, and of awing him into sobriety
and becoming manners; with an instinctive avoidance
she recoils from whatever is gross or uncomely; yet
she can do honour to the true light of intellect and
genius even though it shines through earth-born
vapours and amid base surroundings.</p>
<p>Athens, "the life and light of the whole world," has
sunk under the power of Sparta, and it can be henceforth
no home for Balaustion and her Euthukles.
The bark that bears them is bounding Rhodesward,
and the verse has in it the leap and race of the prow.
Balaustion, stricken at heart, yet feels that this tragedy
of Athens brings the tragic katharsis; the justice of
the gods is visible in it; and above man's wickedness
and folly she reaches to "yon blue liberality of heaven."
It seems as if the spirit which might have saved Athens
<a name="Page_290"></a>is that of the loins girt and the lamp lit which
was
embodied in the strenuous devotion of Euripides to
the highest things; and the spirit which has brought
Athens to its ruin is that expressed with a splendid
power through the work of Aristophanes. But
Aristophanes shall plead for himself and leave nothing
unsaid that can serve to vindicate him as a poet and
even as a moralist Thus only can truth in the end
stand clear, assured of its supremacy over falsehood
and over half-truth.</p>
<p>Nothing that Browning has written is more vividly
imagined than the encounter of Balaustion with
Aristophanes and his crew of revellers on the night
when the tidings of the death of Euripides reached
Athens; it rouses and controls the feelings with the
tumult of life and the sanctity of death, while also
imposing itself on the eye as a brilliant and a solemn
picture. The revellers scatter before the presence of
Balaustion, and she and the great traducer of Euripides
stand face to face. Nowhere else has Browning presented
this conception of the man of vast disorderly
genius, who sees and approves the better way and
splendidly follows the worse:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Such domineering deity<br />
</span><span>Hephaistos might have carved to cut the brine<br />
</span><span>For his gay brother's prow, imbrue that path<br />
</span><span>Which, purpling, recognised the conqueror.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>It is as if male force, with the lust of the eye, the
lust of the flesh, and the pride of life behind it, were
met and held in check by the finer feminine force
resting for its support upon the divine laws. But in
truth Aristophanes is half on the side of Balaustion
<a name="Page_291"></a>and of Euripides; he must, indeed, make his
stand;
he is not one to falter or quail; and yet when the
sudden cloud falls upon his face he knows that it is
his part to make the worse appear the better cause,
knowing this all the more because the justice of
Balaustion's regard perceives and recognises his higher
self. Suddenly the Tuphon, "madding the brine
with wrath or monstrous sport," is transformed into
something like what the child saw once from the
Rhodian sea-coast (the old romantic poet in Browning
is here young once more):</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>All at once, large-looming from his wave,<br />
</span><span>Out leaned, chin hand-propped, pensive on the ledge,<br />
</span><span>A sea-worn face, sad as mortality,<br />
</span><span>Divine with yearning after fellowship.<br />
</span><span>He rose but breast-high. So much god she saw;<br />
</span><span>So much she sees now, and does reverence.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>But in a moment the sea-god is again the sea-monster,
with "tail-splash, frisk of fin"; the majestic
Aristophanes relapses into the most wonderful of
mockers.</p>
<p>No passage in the poem is quite so impressive as
this through its strangeness in beauty. But the entry
of Sophocles&#8212;"an old pale-swathed majesty,"&#8212;at
the supper which followed the performance of the
play, is another of those passages to find which <i>in situ</i>
is a sufficient reward for reading many laborious pages
that might almost as well have been thrown into an
imaginary conversation in prose:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Then the grey brow sank low, and Sophokles<br />
</span><span>Re-swathed him, sweeping doorward: mutely passed<br />
</span><span>'Twixt rows as mute.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_292"></a>The critical study of comedy, its origin, its
development,
its function, its decline, is written with admirable
vigour, but the case of Aristophanes can be read elsewhere.
It is interesting, however, to note the argument
in support of the thesis that comedy points really
to ideals of humanity which are beyond human attainment;
that its mockery of man's infirmities implies a
conception of our nature which in truth is extra-human;
while tragedy on the contrary accepts man as he is,
in his veritable weakness and veritable strength, and
wrings its pity and its terror out of these. It is
Aristophanes who thus vindicates Euripides before the
revellers who have assembled in his own honour, and
they accept what seems to them a paradox as his finest
stroke of irony. But he has indeed after the solemn
withdrawal of Sophocles looked for a moment through
life and death, and seen in his hour of highest success
his depth of failure. For him, in this testing-time of
life, art has been the means of probation; he has
squandered the gifts bestowed upon him, which should
have been concentrated in the special task to which he
was summoned. He should have known&#8212;he did in
fact know&#8212;that the art which "makes grave" is
higher than that which "makes grin"; his own
peculiar duty was to advance his art one step beyond
his predecessors; to create a drama which should
bring into harmony the virtue of tragedy and the
virtue of comedy; to discover the poetry which</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Makes wise, not grave,&#8212;and glad,<br />
</span><span>Not grinning: whereby laughter joins with tears.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Instead of making this advance he had retrograded;
and it remained for a poet of a far-off future in the
<a name="Page_293"></a>far-off Kassiterides&#8212;the Tin Isle which has
Stratford
at its heart&#8212;to accomplish the task on which Aristophanes
would not adventure. One way a brilliant
success was certain for Aristophanes; the other and
better way failure was possible; and he declined to
make the venture of faith. It is with this sense of
self-condemnation upon him that he essays his own
defence, and it is against this sense of self-condemnation
more than against the genius and the
methods of Euripides that he struggles. When
towards the close of the poem he takes in hand the
psalterion, and chants in splendid strains the story of
Thamuris, who aspired and failed, as he himself will
never do, the reader is almost won over to his side.
Browning, who felt the heights and depths of the lyric
genius of Aristophanes, would seem to have resolved
that in this song of "Thamuris marching," moving in
ecstasy amid the glories of an autumn morning, he
would dramatically justify his conception of the poet;
and never in his youth did Browning sing with a finer
rapture of spirit. But reading what follows, the record
of the subjugation of Athens, when the Athenian
people accept the ruin of their defences as if it were
but a fragment of Aristophanic comedy, we perceive
that this song, which breaks off with an uproar of
laughter, is the condemnation as well as the glory of
the singer.</p>
<p>The translation of <i>Agamemnon</i>, the preface to which
is dated "October 1st, 1877," was undertaken at the
request or command of Carlyle. The argument of the
preface fails to justify Browning's method. A translation
"literal at every cost save that of absolute violence
to our language" may be highly desirable; it is
<a name="Page_294"></a>commonly called a "crib"; and a crib contrived
by
one who is not only a scholar but a man of genius will
now and again yield a word or a phrase of felicitous
precision. But that a translation "literal at every
cost" should be put into verse is a wrong both to the
original and to the poetry of the language to which the
original is transferred; it assumes a poetic garb which
in assuming it rends to tatters. A translation into
verse implies that a certain beauty of form is part of
the writer's aim; it implies that a poem is to be reproduced
as a poem, and not as that bastard product
of learned ill judgment&#8212;a glorified crib; and a
glorified crib is necessarily a bad crib. Mrs Orr, who
tells us that Browning refused to regard even the first
of Greek writers as models of literary style, had no
doubt that the translation of the <i>Agamemnon</i> was
partly made for the pleasure of exposing the false
claims made on their behalf. Such a supposition does
not agree well with Browning's own Preface; but if he
had desired to prove that the <i>Agamemnon</i> can be so
rendered as to be barely readable, he has been singularly
successful. From first to last in the genius of
Browning there was an element, showing itself from
time to time, of strange perversity.</p>

<h2>Problem and Narrative Poems</h2>
<br />
<p><i>Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau</i>, which appeared in
December 1871, four months after the publication
of <i>Balaustions Adventure</i>, was written by Browning
during a visit to friends in Scotland. His interest in
modern politics was considerable, but in general it
remained remote from his work as a poet. He professed
himself a liberal, but he was a liberal who
because he was such, claimed the right of independent
judgment. He had rejoiced in the enfranchisement
of Italy. During the American Civil War he was
strongly on the side of the North, as letters to Story,
written when his private grief lay heavy upon him,
abundantly show. He was at one time a friend of the
movement in favour of granting the parliamentary
suffrage to women, but late in life his opinion on this
question altered. He was as decidedly opposed to the
proposals for a separate or subordinate Parliament for
Ireland as were his friends Carlyle and Tennyson and
Matthew Arnold. After the introduction of the Home
Rule Bill he could not bring himself, though requested
by a friend, to write words which would have expressed
or implied esteem for the statesman who had made
that most inopportune experiment in opportunism<a name="FNanchor_112"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> and
whose talents he admired. Yet for a certain kind of
<a name="Page_296"></a>opportunism&#8212;that which conserves rather than
destroys&#8212;Browning
thought that much might fairly be said.
To say this with a special reference to the fallen
Emperor of France he wrote his <i>Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau</i>.</p>
<p>Browning's instinctive sympathies are not with the
"Saviour of Society," who maintains for temporary
reasons a tottering edifice. He naturally applauds
the man who builds on sure foundations, or the man
who in order to reach those foundations boldly
removes the accumulated lumber of the past. But
there are times when perhaps the choice lies only
between conservation of what is imperfect and the
attempt to erect an airy fabric which has no basis
upon the solid earth; and Browning on the whole
preferred a veritable <i>civitas hominum</i>, however remote
from the ideal, to a sham <i>civitas Dei</i> or a real
Cloudcuckootown.
"It is true, that what is settled by
custom, though it be not good, yet at least it is fit;
and those things, which have long gone together, are
as it were confederate within themselves; whereas
new things piece not so well; but though they help
by their utility, yet they trouble by their inconformity."
These words, of one whose worldly wisdom was more
profoundly studied than ever Browning's was, might
stand as a motto for the poem. But the pregnant
sentence of Bacon which follows these words should
be added&#8212;"All this is true if time stood still."
Browning's pleading is not a merely ingenious defence
of the untenable, either with reference to the general
thesis or its application to the French Empire. He
did not, like his wife, think of the Emperor as if he
were a paladin of modern romance; but he honestly
<a name="Page_297"></a>believed that he had for a time done genuine
service&#8212;though
not the highest&#8212;to France and to the
world. "My opinion of the solid good rendered
years ago," he wrote in September 1863 to Story,
"is unchanged. The subsequent deference to the
clerical party in France and support of brigandage is
poor work; but it surely is doing little harm to the
general good." And to Miss Blagden after the
publication of his poem: "I thought badly of him
at the beginning of his career, <i>et pour cause</i>; better
afterward, on the strength of the promises he made,
and gave indications of intending to redeem. I
think him very weak in the last miserable year." It
seemed to Browning a case in which a veritable
<i>apologia</i> was admissible in the interests of truth and
justice, and by placing this <i>apologia</i> in the mouth of
the Emperor himself certain sophistries were also
legitimate that might help to give the whole the
dramatic character which the purposes of poetry, as
the exposition of a complex human character,
required.</p>
<p>The misfortune was that in making choice of such
a subject Browning condemned himself to write with
his left hand, to fight with one arm pinioned, to
exhibit the case on behalf of the "Saviour of Society"
with his brain rather than with brain and heart
acting together. He was to demonstrate that in the
scale of spiritual colours there is a respectable place
for drab. This may be undertaken with skill and
vigour, but hardly with enthusiastic pleasure. <i>Prince
Hohenstiel-Schwangau</i> is an interesting intellectual
exercise, and if this constitutes a poem, a poem it is;
but the theme is fitter for a prose discussion. Brown<a name="Page_298"></a>ing's
intellectual ability became a snare by which the
poet within him was entrapped. The music that he
makes here is the music of Master Hugues of Saxe-Gotha:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>So your fugue broadens and thickens,<br />
</span><span>Greatens and deepens and lengthens,<br />
</span><span>Till one exclaims&#8212;"But where's music, the dickens!"<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The mysterious Sphinx who expounds his riddle
and dissertates on himself in an imaginary Leicester
Square says many things that deserve to be considered;
but they are addressed to our understanding
in the first instance, and only in a secondary and
indirect way reach our feelings and our imagination.
The interest of the poem is virtually exhausted in a
single reading; to a true work of art we return again
and again for renewed delight. We return to <i>Prince
Hohenstiel-Schwangau</i> as to a valuable store-house of
arguments or practical considerations in defence of a
conservative opportunism; but if we have once appropriated
these, we do not need the book. There
is a spirit of conservation, like that of Edmund Burke,
which has in it a wise enthusiasm, we might almost
say a wise mysticism. Browning's Prince is not a
conservator possessed by this enthusiasm. Something
almost pathetic may be felt in his sense that the
work allotted to him is work of mere temporary and
transitory utility. He has no high inspirations such
as support the men who change the face of the world.
The Divine Ruler who has given him his special
faculties, who has enjoined upon him his special tasks,
holds no further communication with him. But he
will do the work of a mere man in a man's strength,
<a name="Page_299"></a>such as it is; he cannot make new things; he can
use the thing he finds; he can for a term of years
"do the best with the least change possible"; he can
turn to good account what is already half-made; and
so, he believes, he can, in a sense, co-operate with God.
So long as he was an irresponsible dreamer, a mere
voice in the air, it was permitted him to indulge in
glorious dreams, to utter shining words. Now that
his feet are on the earth, now that his thoughts
convert themselves into deeds, he must accept the
limitations of earth. The idealists may put forth this
programme and that; his business is not with them
but with the present needs of the humble mass of
his people&#8212;"men that have wives and women that
have babes," whose first demand is bread; by intelligence
and sympathy he will effect "equal sustainment
everywhere" throughout society; and when the man
of genius who is to alter the world arises, such a man
most of all will approve the work of his predecessor,
who left him no mere "shine and shade" on which to
operate, but the good hard substance of common
human life.</p>
<p>All this is admirably put, and it is interesting to
find that Browning, who had rejoiced with Herakles
doing great deeds and purging the world of monsters,
could also honour a poor provisional Atlas whose task
of sustaining a poor imperfect globe upon his shoulders
is less brilliant but not perhaps less useful. Nor
would it be just to overlook the fact that in three or
four pages the poet asserts himself as more than the
prudent casuist. The splendid image of society as a
temple from which winds the long procession of powers
and beauties has in it something of the fine mysticism
<a name="Page_300"></a>of Edmund Burke.<a name="FNanchor_113"></a><a

</span></div>
</div>
<p>It is a passage conceived in the same spirit as the
great chaunt "O Star of France!" written, at the
same date, and with a recognition of both the virtues
and the shames of France, by the American poet of
Democracy. To these memorable fragments from
<i>Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau</i> one other may be added&#8212;that
towards the close of the poem which applies
the tradition of the succession by murder of the
priesthood at the shrine of the Clitumnian god to the
<a name="Page_301"></a>succession of men of genius in the priesthood of
the
world&#8212;"The new power slays the old, but handsomely."</p>
<p>In <i>Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau</i> there is nothing
enigmatical. "It is just what I imagine the man
might, if he pleased, say for himself," so Browning
wrote to Miss Blagden soon after the publication of
the volume. Many persons, however, have supposed
that in <i>Fifine at the Fair</i> (1872) a riddle rather than a
poem was given to the world by the perversity of the
writer. When she comes to speak of this work
Browning's biographer Mrs Orr is half-apologetic; it
is for her "a piece of perplexing cynicism." The
origin of the poem was twofold. The external
suggestion came from the fact that during one of
his visits to Pornic, Browning had seen the original
of his Fifine, and she lived in his memory as a subject
of intellectual curiosity and imaginative interest. The
internal suggestion, as Mrs Orr hints, lay in a certain
mood of resentment against himself arising from the
fact that the encroachments of the world seemed to
estrange in some degree a part of his complex being
from entire fidelity to his own past. The world, in
fact, seemed to be playing with Browning the part of
a Fifine. If this were so, it would be characteristic of
Browning that he should face round upon the world
and come to an explanation with his adversary. But
this could not in a printed volume be done in his own
person; he was not one to take the public into his
confidence. The discussion should be removed as far
as possible from his own circumstances and even his
own feelings. It should be a dramatic debate on the
subject of fidelity and infidelity, on the bearings of
the apparent to the true, on the relation of reality in
<a name="Page_302"></a>this our mortal life to illusion. As he studied
the
subject it assumed new significances and opened up
wider issues. An actual Elvire and an actual Fifine
may be the starting points, but by-and-by Elvire shall
stand for all that is permanent and substantial in
thought and feeling, Fifine for all that is transitory
and illusive. The question of conjugal fidelity is as
much the subject of <i>Fifine at the Fair</i> as the virtue of
tar-water is the subject of Berkeley's <i>Siris</i>. The poem
is in fact Browning's <i>Siris</i>&#8212;a chain of thoughts and
feelings, reaching with no break in the chain, from a
humble basis to the heights of speculation.</p>
<p>But before all else <i>Fifine at the Fair</i> is a poem. Of
all the longer poems which followed <i>The Ring and the
Book</i> it is the most sustained and the most diversified
in imaginative power. To point out passages of
peculiar beauty, passages vivid in feeling, original in
thought, would here be out of place; for the brilliance
and vigour are unflagging, and what we have to complain
of is the lack of some passages of repose. The
joy in freedom&#8212;freedom accepting some hidden law&#8212;of
these poor losels and truants from convention, who
stroll it and stage it, the gypsy figure of Fifine in page-costume,
the procession of imagined beauties&#8212;Helen,
Cleopatra, the Saint of Pornic Church&#8212;the half-emerging,
half-undelivered statue by Michelagnolo, the praise
of music as nearer to the soul than words, sunset at
Saint-Marie, the play of the body in the sea at noontide
(with all that it typifies), woman as the rillet
leaping to the sea, woman as the dolphin that upbears
Orion, the Venetian carnival, which is the carnival of
human life, darkness fallen upon the plains, and through
the darkness the Druidic stones gleaming&#8212;all these
<a name="Page_303"></a>are essentially parts of the texture of the
poem, yet
each has a lustre or a shimmer or grave splendour of
its own.</p>
<p>It is strange that any reader should have supposed
either the Prologue or the Epilogue to be uttered by
the imaginary speaker of the poem. Both shadow
forth the personal feelings of Browning; the prologue
tells of the gladness he still found both in the world of
imagination and the world of reality, over which hovers
the spirit that had once been so near his own, the
spirit that is near him still, yet moving on a different
plane, perhaps wondering at or pitying this life of his,
which yet he accepts with cheer and will turn to the
best account; the epilogue veils behind its grim
humour the desolate feeling that came upon him again
and again as a householder in this house of life, for
behind the happiness which he strenuously maintained,
there lay a great desolation. But the last word of
the epilogue&#8212;"Love is all and Death is nought" is a
word of sustainment wrung out of sorrow. These
poems have surely in them no "perplexing cynicism,"
nor has the poem enclosed between them, when it is
seen aright. Browning's idea in the poem he declared
in reply to a question of Dr Furnivall, "was to show
merely how a Don Juan might justify himself, partly
by truth, somewhat by sophistry." No more unhappy
misnomer than this "Don Juan" could have been
devised for the curious, ingenious, learned experimenter
in life, no man of pleasure, in the vulgar sense of the
word, but a deliberate explorer of thoughts and things,
who argues out his case with so much fine casuistry
and often with the justest conceptions of human character
and conduct. If we could discover a dividing
<a name="Page_304"></a>line between his truth and his sophistry, we
might
discover also that the poem is no exceptional work of
Browning, for which an apology is required, but of a
piece with his other writings and in harmony with the
body of thought and feeling expressed through them.
Now it is certain that as Browning advanced in years
he more and more distrusted the results of the intellect
in its speculative research; he relied more and more
upon the knowledge that comes through or is embodied
in love. Love by its very nature implies a relation; what
is felt is real for us. But the intellect, which aspires
to know things as they are, forever lands us in illusions&#8212;illusions
needful for our education, and therefore far
from unprofitable, to be forever replaced by fresh
illusions; and the only truth we thus attain is the
conviction that truth there assuredly is, that we must
forever reach after it, and must forever grasp its
shadow. Theologies, philosophies, scientific theories&#8212;these
change like the shifting and shredding clouds
before our eyes, and are forever succeeded by clouds
of another shape and hue. But the knowledge involved
in love is veritable and is verified at least for us who
love. While in his practice he grew more scientific in
research for truth, and less artistic in his desire for
beauty, such was the doctrine which Browning upheld.</p>
<p>The speaker in <i>Fifine at the Fair</i> is far more a
seeker for knowledge than he is a lover. And he has
learnt, and learnt aright, that by illusions the intellect
is thrown forward towards what may relatively be
termed the truth; through shadows it advances upon
reality. When he argues that philosophies and
theologies are the fizgigs of the brain, its Fifines the
false which lead us onward to Elvire the true, he
<a name="Page_305"></a>expresses an idea which Browning has repeatedly
expressed in <i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i> and which, certainly,
was an idea he had made his own. And if a man
approaches the other sex primarily with a view to
knowledge, with a view to confirm and to extend his
own self-consciousness and to acquire experience of
the strength and the weakness of womanhood, it is
true that he will be instructed more widely, if not
more deeply, by Elvire supplemented by Fifine than
by Elvire alone. The sophistry of the speaker in
Browning's poem consists chiefly in a juggle between
knowledge and love, and in asserting as true of love
what Browning held to be, in the profoundest sense,
true of knowledge. The poet desires, as Butler in his
"Analogy" desired, to take lower ground than his
own; but the curious student of man and woman, of
love and knowledge&#8212;imagination aiding his intellect&#8212;is
compelled, amid his sophistical jugglings, to work
out his problems upon Browning's own lines, and he
becomes a witness to Browning's own conclusions.
Saul, before the poem closes, is also among the
prophets. For him, as for Browning, "God and the
soul stand sure." He sees, as Browning sees, man
reaching upward through illusions&#8212;religious theories,
philosophical systems, scientific hypotheses, artistic
methods, scholarly attainments&#8212;to the Divine. The
Pornic fair has become the Venice carnival, and this
has grown to the vision of man's life, in which the
wanton and coquette named a philosophy or a theology
has replaced the gipsy in tricot. The speaker misapplies
to love and the truths obtained by love Browning's
doctrine concerning knowledge. And yet, even
so, he is forced to confess, however inconsistent his
<a name="Page_306"></a>action may be with his belief, that the
permanent&#8212;which
is the Divine&#8212;can be reached through a single,
central point of human love, but not through any vain
attempt to manufacture an infinite by piecing together
a multitude of detached points:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>His problem posed aright<br />
</span><span>Was&#8212;"From a given point evolve the infinite!"<br />
</span><span>Not&#8212;"Spend thyself in space, endeavouring to joint<br />
</span><span>Together, and so make infinite, point and point:<br />
</span><span>Fix into one Elvire a Fair-ful of Fifines!"<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>If he continues his experiments, they are experiments
of the senses or of the intellect, which he knows
can bring no profit to the heart: "Out of thine own
mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant." He
will undoubtedly&#8212;let this be frankly acknowledged&#8212;grow
in a certain kind of knowledge, and as certainly
he will dwindle in the higher knowledge that comes
through love. The poem is neither enigmatical nor
cynical, but in entire accord with Browning's own
deepest convictions and highest feelings.<a name="FNanchor_115"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>
<p>Although in his later writings Browning rendered
ever more and more homage to the illuminating power
of the affections, his methods unfortunately became,
as has been said, more and more scientific, or&#8212;shall
we say?&#8212;pseudo-scientific. Art jealously selects its
subjects, those which possess in a high degree spiritual
or material beauty, or that more complete beauty
which unites the two. Science accepts any subject
which promises to yield its appropriate truth. Browning,
probing after psychological truth, became too
<a name="Page_307"></a>indifferent to the truth of beauty. Or shall we
say
that his vision of beauty became enlarged, so that in
laying bare by dissection the anatomy of any poor
corpse, he found an artistic joy in studying the enlacements
of veins and nerves? To say this is perhaps
to cheat oneself with words. His own defence would,
doubtless, have been a development of two lines which
occur near the close of <i>Red Cotton Night-Cap Country</i>:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Love bids touch truth, endure truth, and
embrace<br />
</span><span>Truth, though, embracing truth, love crush itself.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>And he would have pleaded that art, which he styles</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The love of loving, rage<br />
</span><span>Of knowing, seeing, feeling the absolute truth of things<br />
</span><span>For truth's sake, whole and sole,<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>may "crush itself" for sake of the truth which is its
end and aim. But the greatest masters have not
sought for beauty merely or mainly in the dissection
of ugliness, nor did they find their rejoicing in artistic
suicide for the sake of psychological discovery. To
Browning such a repulsive story as that of <i>Red Cotton
Night-Cap Country</i> served now as well as one which in
earlier days would have attracted him by its grandeur
or its grace. Here was a fine morbid growth, an
exemplary moral wen, the enormous product of two
kinds of corruption&#8212;sensuality and superstition, and
what could be a more fortunate field for exploration
with aid of the scalpel? The incidents of the poem
were historical and were recent. Antoine Mellerio,
the sometime jeweller of Paris, had flung himself from
his belvedere in 1870; the suit, which raised the
question of his sanity at the date when his will had
been signed, was closed in 1872; the scene of his
<a name="Page_308"></a>death was close to Browning's place of summer
sojourn,
Saint-Aubin. The subject lay close to Browning's
hand. It was an excellent subject for a short story
of the kind that gets the name of realistic. It was an
unfortunate subject for a long poem. But the botanist
who desires to study vegetable physiology does not
require a lily or a rose. Browning who viewed things
from the ethical as well as the psychological standpoint
was attracted to the story partly because it was,
he thought, a story with a moral. He did not merely
wish to examine as a spiritual chemist the action of
Castilian blood upon a French brain, to watch and
make a report upon the behaviour of inherited faith
when brought into contact with acquired scepticism&#8212;the
scepticism induced by the sensual temperament of
the boulevards; he did not merely wish to exhibit the
difficulties and dangers of a life divided against itself.
His purpose was also to rebuke that romantic sentimentalism
which would preserve the picturesque lumber
of ruined faiths and discredited opinions, that have
done their work, and remain only as sources of danger
to persons who are weak of brain and dim of sight.
Granted the conditions, it was, Browning maintains,
an act of entire sanity on the part of his sorry hero,
Monsieur L&eacute;once Miranda, to fling himself into mid
air, to put his faith to the final test, and trust to our
Blessed Lady, the bespangled and bejewelled Ravissante,
to bear him in safety through the air. But the
conditions were deplorable; and those who declined
to assist in carting away the rubbish of medievalism
are responsible for L&eacute;once Miranda's bloody night-cap.</p>
<p>The moral is just, and the story bears it well. Yet
Browning's own conviction that man's highest and
<a name="Page_309"></a>clearest faith is no more than a shadow of the
unattainable
truth may for a moment give us pause.
An iconoclast, even such an iconoclast as Voltaire, is
ordinarily a man of unqualified faith in the conclusions
of the intellect. If our best conceptions of things
divine be but a kind of parable, why quarrel with the
parables accepted by other minds than our own?
The answer is twofold. First Browning was not a
sceptic with respect to the truths attained through
love, and he held that mankind had already attained
through love truths that condemned the religion of
self-torture and terrified propitiations, which led L&eacute;once
Miranda to reduce his right hand and his left to
carbonised stumps and dragged him kneeling along
the country roads to manifest his devotion to the
image of the Virgin. Secondly he held that our
education through intellectual illusions is a progressive
education, and that to seek to live in an obsolete
illusion is treason against humanity. Therefore his
exhortation is justified by his logic:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Quick conclude<br />
</span><span>Removal, time effects so tardily,<br />
</span><span>Of what is plain obstruction; rubbish cleared,<br />
</span><span>Let partial-ruin stand while ruin may,<br />
</span><span>And serve world's use, since use is manifold.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The tower which once served as a belfry may possibly
be still of use to some Father Secchi to "tick Venus
off in transit"; only never bring bell again to the
partial-ruin,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>To damage him aloft, brain us below,<br />
</span><span>When new vibrations bury both in brick.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>For which sane word, if not for all the pages of his
poem, we may feel gratefully towards the writer. It
<a name="Page_310"></a>is the word of Browning the moralist. The study
of
the double-minded hero belongs to Browning the
psychologist. The admirable portrait of Clara, the
successful adventuress, harlot and favoured daughter
of the Church, is the chief gift received through this
poem from Browning the artist. She is a very
admirable specimen of her kind&#8212;the <i>mamestra brassicae</i>
species of caterpillar, and having with beautiful aplomb
outmanoeuvred and flouted the rapacious cousinry, Clara
is seen at the last, under the protection of Holy Church,
still quietly devouring her Miranda leaf&#8212;such is the irony
of nature, and the merit of a perfect digestive apparatus.</p>
<p>The second narrative poem of this period, <i>The Inn
Album</i> (1875), is in truth a short series of dramatic
scenes, placed in a narrative frame-work. It is as
concentrated as <i>Red Cotton Night-Cap Country</i> is
diffuse; and the unities of time and place assist the
tragic concentration. A recast of <i>The Inn Album</i> might
indeed have appeared as a drama on the Elizabethan
stage side by side with such a brief masterpiece, piteous
and terrible, as "A Yorkshire Tragedy"; it moves
with a like appalling rapidity towards the climax and
the catastrophe. The incident of the attempted
barter of a discarded mistress to clear off the score
of a gambling debt is derived from the scandalous
chronicle of English nineteenth century society.<a name="FNanchor_116"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a>
Browning's tale of crime was styled on its appearance
by a distinguished critic of Elizabethan drama the
story of a "penny dreadful." He was right; but he
should have added that some of the most impressive
and elevated pieces of our dramatic literature have
<a name="Page_311"></a>had sources of no greater dignity. The story of
the
"penny dreadful" is here rehandled and becomes a
tragedy of which the material part is only a translation
into external deed of a tragedy of the soul. The
<i>dramatis personae</i>, as refashioned from the crude fact
and the central passions of the poem, were such as
would naturally call forth what was characteristic in
Browning's genius. A martyr of love, a traitor to
love, an avenger of love,&#8212;these are the central figures.
The girlish innocence of the cousin is needed only as
a ray of morning sunlight to relieve the eye that is
strained and pained by the darkness and the pallor of
the faces of the exponents of passion. And a like
effect is produced by the glimpses of landscape, rich
in the English qualities of cultured gladness and
repose, which Browning so seldom presented, but
which are perfectly rendered here:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The wooded watered country, hill and dale<br />
</span><span>And steel-bright thread of stream, a-smoke with mist,<br />
</span><span>A-sparkle with May morning, diamond drift<br />
</span><span>O' the sun-touched dew.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>We must feel that life goes on with leisurely happiness
outside the little room that isolates its tragic
occupants; the smoke from fires of turf and wood
is in the air; cottagers are at their morning cookery.
After all the poet of the inn album was well inspired
in his eloquent address:&#8212;"Hail, calm acclivity, salubrious
spot!" and only certain incidents, which time
will soon efface, have touched the salutation with irony.</p>
<p>In this poem Browning reverts to his earlier method
of clearly and simply dividing the evil from the good.
We are not embarrassed by the mingling of truth
with sophistry; our instinctive sympathies are not
<a name="Page_312"></a>held in check, but are on the contrary
reinforced by
the undisguised sympathies of the writer. We are
no more in doubt where wrong and where justice lie
than if Count Gismond were confronting Count
Gauthier. The avenger, indeed, is no champion of
romance; he is only a young English snob, a little
slow of brain, a little unrefined in manner, a "clumsy
giant handsome creature," who for a year has tried to
acquire under an accomplished tutor the lore of
cynical worldliness, and has not succeeded, for he is
manly and honest, and has the gentleness of strength;
"for ability, all's in the rough yet." Of his education
the best part is that he has once loved and been
thwarted in his love. And now in a careless-earnest
regard for his cousin his need is that of occupation
for his big, idle boy's heart; he wants something to
do, someone also to serve. Browning wishes to show
the passion of righteousness, which suddenly flames
forth and abolishes an evil thing as springing from
no peculiar knightly virtue but from mere honest
human nature. The huge boy, somewhat crude, somewhat
awkward, with a moral temper still unclarified,
has enough of our good, common humanity in him
to hold no parley with utter wickedness, when once he
fully apprehends its nature; therefore he springs upon
it in one swift transport of rage and there and then makes
an end of it. His big red hands are as much the instruments
of divine justice as is the axe of Iv&agrave;n Iv&agrave;novitch.</p>
<p>The traitor of the poem is "refinement every inch
from brow to boot-heel"; and in this respect it cannot
be said that Browning's villain departs widely from
the conventional, melodramatic villain of the stage. He
has perhaps like the stage villain a little too much
<a name="Page_313"></a>of that cheap knowingness, which is the
theatrical
badge of the complete man of the world, but which
gentlemen in actual life do not ordinarily affect.
There is here and elsewhere in Browning's later poetry
somewhat too free an indulgence in this cheap knowingness,
as if with a nod and a wink he would inform
us that he has a man of the world's acquaintance with
the shady side of life; and this is not quite good art,
nor is it quite good manners. The vulgarity of the
man in the street may have a redeeming touch of
animal spirits, if not of <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>, in it; the
vulgarity
of the man in the club, "refinement every inch" is
beyond redemption. The exhibition of Browning's
traitor as having slipped lower and lower down the
slopes of baseness because he has been false to his
one experience of veritable love may remind us also
of the melodramatic stage villain; but the tragic and
pathetic motives of melodrama, its demonstrative
heroisms, its stage generosities, its striking attitudes,
are really fictions founded upon fact, and the facts
which give some credit to the stage fictions remain
for the true creator of tragedy to discover and interpret
aright. The melodramatic is often the truth falsely
or feebly handled; the same truth handled aright may
become tragic. There is much in Shakespeare's plays
which if treated by an inferior artist would at once
sink from tragedy to melodrama. Browning escapes
from melodrama but not to such a safe position that
we can quite forget its neighbourhood. When the
traitor of this poem is withdrawn&#8212;as was Guido&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Into that sad obscure sequestered state<br />
</span><span>Where God unmakes but to remake the soul<br />
</span><span>He else made first in vain,<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_314"></a>there will be found in him that he knew the
worth
of love, that he saw the horror of the void in
which he lived, and that for a moment&#8212;though too
late&#8212;a sudden wave of not ignoble passion overwhelmed
his baser self, even if only to let the fangs
of the treacherous rock reappear in their starkness
and cruelty.</p>
<p>The lady, again, with her superb statue-like beauty,
her low wide brow</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Oppressed by sweeps of hair<br />
</span><span>Darker and darker as they coil and swathe<br />
</span><span>The crowned corpse-wanness whence the eyes burn black,<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>her passion, her despair, her recovery through chilling
to ice the heart within her, her reawakening to life,
and the pain of that return to sensation, her measureless
scorn of her betrayer, her exposure of his last
fraud, and her self-sought death&#8212;the lady is dangerously
near the melodramatic heroine, and yet she is not
a melodramatic but a tragic figure. Far more than
Pompilia, who knew the joy of motherhood, is she
the martyr of love. And yet, before she quits life,
in her protective care of that somewhat formidable,
somewhat ungainly baby, the huge boy, her champion,
hero and snob, she finds a comforting maternal instinct
at work:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Did you love me once?<br />
</span><span>Then take love's last and best return! I think<br />
</span><span>Womanliness means only motherhood;<br />
</span><span>All love begins and ends there,&#8212;roams enough,<br />
</span><span>But, having run the circle, rests at home.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Her husband, good man, will not suffer acutely for
her loss; he will be true to duty, and continue to dose
<a name="Page_315"></a>his flock with the comfortable dogma of
hell-fire, in
which not one of them believes.</p>
<p>The <i>Pacchiarotto</i> volume of 1876 was the first collection
of miscellaneous poetry put forth by Browning
since the appearance, twelve years previously, of
<i>Dramatis Personae</i><a name="FNanchor_117"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> There is, of course,
throughout
the whole the presence of a vigorous personality; we
can in an occasional mood tumble and toss even in
the rough verse of <i>Pacchiarotto</i>, as we do on a choppy
sea on which the sun is a-shine, and which invigorates
while it&#8212;not always agreeably&#8212;bobs our head, and
dashes down our throat. But vigour alone does not
produce poetry, and it may easily run into a kind
of good-humoured effrontery. The speciality of the
volume as compared with its predecessors is that it
contains not a little running comment by Browning
upon himself and his own work, together with a jocular-savage
reply to his unfriendly critics. There is a
little too much in all this of the robustious Herakles
sending his great voice before him. An author ought
to be aware of the fact that no pledge to admire him
and his writings has been administered to every one
who enters the world, and that as sure as he attracts,
so surely must he repel. In the <i>Epilogue</i> the poet
informs his readers that those who expect from him,
or from any poet, strong wine of verse which is also
sweet demand the impossible. Sweet the strong wine
can become only after it has long lain mellowing in
the cask. The experience of Browning's readers contradicted
the assertion. Some who drank the good
wines of 1855 and of 1864 in the year of the vintages
<a name="Page_316"></a>found that they were strong and needed no
keeping
to be sweet. Wine-tasters must make distinctions,
and the quality of the yield of 1876 does not entitle
it to be remembered as an extraordinary year.</p>
<p>The poem from which the volume was named tells
in verse, "timed by raps of the knuckle," how the
painter Pacchiarotto must needs become a world-reformer,
or at least a city-reformer in his distressed
Siena, with no good results for his city and with
disastrous results for himself. He learns by unsavoury
experience his lesson, to hold on by the
paint-brush and maul-stick, and do his own work,
accepting the mingled evil and good of life in a
spirit of strenuous&#8212;not indolent&#8212;<i>laissez-faire</i>, playing,
as energetically as a human being can, his own
part, and leaving others to play theirs, assured that
for all and each this life is the trial-time and test
of eternity, the rehearsal for the performance in a
future world, and "Things rarely go smooth at
Rehearsal." Browning's joy in difficult rhyming as
seen in this serio-grotesque jingle was great; some
readers may be permitted to wish that many of his
rhymes were not merely difficult but impossible. At
a dinner given by Sir Leslie Stephen he met successfully
the challenge to produce a rhyme for "rhinoceros,"
and for Tennyson's diversion he delivered himself of
an impromptu in which rhymes were found for
"Ecclefechan" and "Craigenputtock." But in rhyming
ingenuity Browning is inferior to the author of
"Hudibras," in a rhymer's elegant effrontery he is
inferior to the author of "Don Juan." Browning's
good-humoured effrontery in his rhymes expects too
much good-humour from his reader, who may be
<a name="Page_317"></a>amiable enough to accept rough and ready
successes,
but cannot often be delighted by brilliant gymnastics
of sound and sense. In like manner it asks for a
particularly well-disposed reader to appreciate the wit
of Browning's retort upon his critics: "You are
chimney-sweeps," he sings out in his great voice,
"listen! I have invented several insulting nicknames
for you. Decamp! or my housemaid will fling the
slops in your faces." This may appear to some
persons to be genial and clever. It certainly has none of
the exquisite malignity of Pope's poisoned rapier. Perhaps
it is a little dull; perhaps it is a little outrageous.</p>
<p>The Browning who masks as Shakespeare in <i>At the
Mermaid</i> disclaims the ambition of heading a poetical
faction, condemns the Byronic <i>Welt-schmerz</i>, and announces
his resolvedly cheerful acceptance of life.
Elsewhere he assures his readers that though his
work is theirs his life is his own; he will not unlock
his heart in sonnets. Such is the drift of the verses
entitled <i>House</i>; a peep through the window is permitted,
but "please you, no foot over threshold of
mine." This was not Shakespeare's wiser way; if he
hid himself behind his work, it was with the openness
and with the taciturnity of Nature. He did not stand
in the window of his "House" declaring that he was
not to be seen; he did not pull up and draw down
the blind to make it appear that he was at home and
not at home. In the poem <i>Shop</i> Browning continues
his assurances that he is no Eglamor to whom verse
is "a temple-worship vague and vast." Verse-making
is his trade as jewel-setting and jewel-selling is the
goldsmith's&#8212;but do you suppose that the poet lives
no life of his own?&#8212;how and where it is not for you
<a name="Page_318"></a>to guess, only be certain it is far away from
his counter
and his till. These poems were needless confidences
to the public that no confidences would be vouchsafed
to them.</p>
<p>But the volume of 1876 contains better work than
these pieces of self-assertion. The two love-lyrics
<i>Natural Magic</i> and <i>Magical Nature</i> have each of
them a surprise of beauty; the one tells of the fairy-tale
of love, the other of its inward glow and gem-like
stability. <i>Bifurcation</i> is characteristic of the writer;
the woman who chooses duty rather than love may
have done well, but she has chosen the easier way and
perhaps has evaded the probation of life; the man
who chooses passion rather than duty has slipped and
stumbled, but his was the harder course and perhaps
the better. Which of the two was sinner? which
was saint? To be impeccable may be the most
damning of offences. In <i>St Martin's Summer</i> the
eerie presence of ghosts of dead loves, haunting a
love that has grown upon the graves of the past, is
a check upon passion, which by a sudden turn at the
close triumphs in a victory that is defeat. <i>Fears and
Scruples</i> is a confession of the trials of theistic faith in
a world from which God seems to be an absentee.
What had been supposed to be letters from our friend
are proved forgeries; what we called his loving actions
are the accumulated results of the natural law of
heredity. Yet even if theism had to be abandoned,
it would have borne fruit:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>All my days I'll go the softlier, sadlier<br />
</span><span>For that dream's sake! How forget the thrill<br />
</span><span>Through and through me as I thought "The gladlier<br />
</span><span>Lives my friend because I love him still?"<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_319"></a>And the friend will value love all the more
which
persists through the obstacles of partial ignorance.<a
 name="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a>
The blank verse monologue <i>A Forgiveness</i>, Browning's
"Spanish Tragedy," is a romance of passion, subtle in
its psychology, tragic in its action. Out of its darkness
gleams especially one resplendent passage&#8212;the
description of those weapons of Eastern workmanship&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Horror coquetting with voluptuousness&#8212;<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>one of which is the instrument chosen by the husband's
hatred, now replacing his contempt, to confer on his
wife a death that is voluptuous. The grim-grotesque
incident from the history of the Jews in Italy related
in <i>Filippo Baldinucci</i> recalls the comedy and the pathos
of <i>Holy Cross Day</i>, to which it is in every respect
inferior. The Jew of the centuries of Christian persecution
is for Browning's imagination a being
half-sublime
and half-grotesque, and wholly human.
<i>Cenciaja</i>, a note in verse connected with Shelley's
<i>Cenci</i>, would be excellent as a note in prose appended
to the tragedy, explaining, as it does, why the Pope,
inclining to pardon Beatrice, was turned aside from
his purposes of mercy; it rather loses than gains in
value by having been thrown into verse. To recover
our loyalty to Browning as a poet, which this volume
sometimes puts to the test, we might well reserve
<i>Numpholeptos</i> for the close. The pure and disempassioned
in womanly form is brought face to face
with the passionate and sullied lover, to whom her
charm is a tyranny; she is no warm sun but a white
moon rising above this lost Endymion, who never
<a name="Page_320"></a>slumbers but goes forth on hopeless quests at
the
bidding of his mistress, and wins for all his reward
the "sad, slow, silver smile," which is now pity, now
disdain, and never love. The subjugating power of
chaste and beautiful superiority to passion over this
mere mortal devotee is absolute and inexorable. Is
the nymph an abstraction and incarnation of something
that may be found in womanhood? Is she an
embodiment of the Ideal, which sends out many
questers, and pities and disdains them when they
return soiled and defeated? Soft and sweet as she
appears, she is <i>La belle Dame sans merci</i>, and her
worshipper is as desperately lost as the knight-at-arms
of Keats's poem.</p>

<h2>Solitude and Society</h2>
<br />
<p>The volume which consists of <i>La Saisiaz</i> and <i>The
Two Poets of Croisic</i> (1878) brings the work of this
decade to a close.<a name="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a>
<i>La Saisiaz</i>, the record of thoughts
that were awakened during that solitary clamber to
the summit of Sal&egrave;ve after the death of Miss Egerton-Smith,
is not an elegy, but it remains with us as a
memorial of friendship. In reading it we discern the
tall white figure of the "stranger lady," leaning through
the terrace wreaths of leaf and bloom, or pacing that
low grass-path which she had loved and called her
own. It serves Browning's purpose in the poem that
she should have been one of those persons who in this
world have not manifested all that lies within them.
Does she still exist, or is she now no more than the
thing which lies in the little enclosure at Collonge?
The poem after its solemn and impressive prelude
becomes the record of an hour's debate of the writer
with himself&#8212;a debate which has a definite aim and
is brought to a definite issue. In conducting that
debate on immortality, Browning is neither Christian
nor anti-Christian. The Christian creed involves a
question of history; he cannot here admit historical
considerations; he will see the matter out as he is an in<a
 name="Page_322"></a>dividual
soul, on the grounds suggested by his individual
consciousness and his personal knowledge. It may be
that any result he arrives at is a result for himself alone.</p>
<p>But why conduct an argument in verse? Is not
prose a fitter medium for such a discussion? The
answer is that the poem is more than an argument; it
is the record in verse of an experience, the story of a
pregnant and passionate hour, during which passion
quickened the intellect; and the head, while resisting
all illusions of the heart, was roused to that resistance
by the heart itself. Such an hour is full of events; it
may be almost epic in its plenitude of action; but the
events are ideas. The frame and setting of the
discussion also are more than frame and setting; they
co-operate with the thoughts; they form part of the
experience. The poet is alone among the mountains,
with dawn and sunset for associates, Jura thrilled to
gold at sunrise, Sal&egrave;ve in its evening rose-bloom, Mont-Blanc
which strikes greatness small; or at night he is
beneath the luminous worlds which</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>One by one came lamping&#8212;chiefly that
prepotency of Mars.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>While he climbs towards the summit he is aware of
"Earth's most exquisite disclosures, heaven's own God
in evidence"; he stands face to face with Nature&#8212;"rather
with Infinitude." All through his mountain
ascent the vigour of life is aroused within him; and,
as he returns&#8212;there is her grave.</p>
<p>The idea of a future life, for which this earthly life
serves as an education and a test, is so central with
Browning, so largely influences all his feelings and
penetrates all his art, that it is worth while to attend
to the course of his argument and the nature of his
<a name="Page_323"></a>conclusion. He puts the naked question to
himself&#8212;What
does death mean? Is it total extinction? Is it
a passage into life?&#8212;without any vagueness, without
any flattering metaphor; he is prepared to accept or
endure any answer if only it be the truth. Whether
his discussion leads to a trustworthy result or not, the
sincerity and the energy of his endeavour after truth
serve to banish all supine and half-hearted moods.
The debate, of which his poem is a report, falls into
two parts: first, a statement of facts; secondly, a
series of conjectures&#8212;conjectures and no more&#8212;rising
from the basis of facts that are ascertained. To put
the question, "Shall I survive death?" is to assume
that I exist and that something other than myself
exists which causes me now to live and presently to
die. The nature of this power outside myself I do
not know; we may for convenience call it "God."
Beyond these two facts&#8212;myself and a power environing
me&#8212;nothing is known with certainty which has
any bearing on the matter in dispute. I am like a
floating rush borne onward by a stream; whither
borne the rush cannot tell; but rush and stream are
facts that cannot be questioned.</p>
<p>Knowing that I exist&#8212;Browning goes on&#8212;I know
what for me is pain and what is pleasure. And, however
it may be with others, for my own part I can
pronounce upon the relation of joy to sorrow in this
my life on earth:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>I must say&#8212;or choke in silence&#8212;&#8212;"Howsoever
came my fate,<br />
</span><span>Sorrow did and joy did nowise&#8212;life well
weighed&#8212;preponderate."<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>If this failure be ordained by necessity, I shall bear
it as best I can; but, if this life be all, nothing shall
<a name="Page_324"></a>force me to say that life has proceeded from a
cause
supreme in goodness, wisdom, and power. What I
find here is goodness always intermixed with evil;
wisdom which means an advance from error to the confession
of ignorance; power that is insufficient to adapt
a human being to his surroundings even in the degree
in which a worm is fitted to the leaf on which it feeds.</p>
<p>Browning tacitly rejects the idea that the world is
the work of some blind, force; and undoubtedly our
reason, which endeavours to reduce all things in nature
to rational conceptions, demands that we should conceive
the world as rational rather than as some wild
work of chance. Upon one hypothesis, and upon one
alone, can the life of man upon this globe appear the
result of intelligence:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>I have lived then, done and suffered, loved
and hated, learnt and taught<br />
</span><span>This&#8212;there is no reconciling wisdom with a world
distraught,<br />
</span><span>Goodness with triumphant evil, power with failure in the
aim,<br />
</span><span>If (to my own sense, remember! though none other feel the
same!)<br />
</span><span>If you bar me from assuming earth to be a pupil's place,<br />
</span><span>And life, time,&#8212;with all their chances, changes,&#8212;just
probation&#8212;space,<br />
</span><span>Mine for me.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Grant this hypothesis, and all changes from irrational
to rational, from evil to good, from pain to a strenuous
joy:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Only grant a second life, I acquiesce<br />
</span><span>In this present life as failure, count misfortune's worst
assaults<br />
</span><span>Triumph, not defeat, assured that loss so much the more
exalts<br />
</span><span>Gain about to be.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Thus out of defeat springs victory; never are we so
near to knowledge as when we are checked at the
<a name="Page_325"></a>bounds of ignorance; beauty is felt through its
opposite;
good is known through evil; truth shows its potency
when it is confronted by falsehood;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>While for love&#8212;Oh how but, losing love, does
whoso loves succeed<br />
</span><span>By the death-pang to the birth-throe&#8212;learning what is love
indeed?<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Yet at best this idea of a future life remains a conjecture,
an hypothesis, a hope, which gives a key to
the mysteries of our troubled earthly state. Browning
proceeds to argue that such a hope is all that we can
expect or ought to desire. The absolute assurance of
a future life and of rewards and punishments consequent
on our deeds in the present world would defeat
the very end for which, according to the hypothesis,
we are placed here; it would be fatal to the purpose
of our present life considered as a state of probation.
What such a state of probation requires is precisely what
we have&#8212;hope; no less than this and no more. Does
our heaven overcloud because we lack certainty? No:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Hope the arrowy, just as constant, comes to
pierce its gloom, compelled<br />
</span><span>By a power and by a purpose which, if no one else beheld,<br />
</span><span>I behold in life, so&#8212;hope!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Such is the conclusion with Browning of the whole
matter. It is in entire accordance with a letter which
he wrote two years previously to a lady who supposed
herself to be dying, and who had thanked him for
help derived from his poems: "All the help I can
offer, in my poor degree, is the assurance that I see
ever <i>more</i> reason to hold by the same hope&#8212;and that
by no means in ignorance of what has been advanced
to the contrary.... God bless you, sustain you, and
<a name="Page_326"></a>receive you." To Dr Moncure Conway, who had lost
a son, Browning wrote: "If I, who cannot, would
restore your son, He who can, will." And Mr Rudolph
Lehmann records his words in conversation: "I have
doubted and denied it [a future life], and I fear have
even printed my doubts; but now I am as deeply
convinced that there is something after death. If you
ask me what, I no more know it than my dog knows
who and what I am. He knows that I am there and
that is enough for him."<a name="FNanchor_120"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>
<p>Browning's confession in <i>La Saisias</i> that the sorrow
of his life outweighed its joy is not inconsistent with
his habitual cheerfulness of manner. Such estimates
as this are little to be trusted. One great shock of
pain may stand for ever aloof from all other experiences;
the pleasant sensations of many days pass
from our memory. We cannot tell. But that Browning
supposed himself able to tell is in itself worthy of
note. In <i>The Two Poets of Croisic</i>, which was written
in London immediately after <i>La Saisiaz</i>, and which,
though of little intrinsic importance, shows that
Browning was capable of a certain grace in verse
that is light, he pleads that the power of victoriously
dealing with pain and transforming it into strength
may be taken as the test of a poet's greatness:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Yoke Hatred, Crime, Remorse,<br />
</span><span>Despair: but ever 'mid the whirling fear,<br />
</span><span>Let, through the tumult, break the poet's face<br />
</span><span>Radiant, assured his wild slaves win the race.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>This is good counsel for art; but not wholly wise
counsel for life. Sorrow, indeed, is not wronged by a
<a name="Page_327"></a>cheerfulness cultivated and strenuously
maintained;
but gladness does suffer a certain wrong. Sunshine
comes and goes; the attempt to substitute any unrelieved
light for sunshine is somewhat of a failure at
the best. Shadows and brightness pursuing each
other according to the course of nature make more for
genuine happiness than does any stream of moral
electricity worked from a dynamo of the will. It is
pleasanter to encounter a breeze that sinks and swells,
that lingers and hastens, than to face a vigorous and
sustained gale even of a tonic quality. Browning's
unfailing cheer and cordiality of manner were admirable;
they were in part spontaneous, in part an
acceptance of duty, in part a mode of self-protection;
they were only less excellent than the varying moods
of a simple and beautiful nature.</p>
<p>When <i>La Saisiaz</i> appeared Browning was sixty-six
years old. He lived for more than eleven years
longer, during which period he published six volumes
of verse, showing new powers as a writer of brief poetic
narrative and as a teacher through parables; but he
produced no single work of prolonged and sustained
effort&#8212;which perhaps was well. His physical vigour
continued for long unabated. He still enjoyed the
various pleasures and excitements of the London
season; but it is noted by Mrs Orr that after the
death of Miss Egerton-Smith he "almost mechanically
renounced all the musical entertainments to which she
had so regularly accompanied him." His daily habits
were of the utmost regularity, varying hardly at all
from week to week. He was averse, says Mrs Orr,
"to every hought of change," and chose rather to
adapt himself to external conditions than to enter on
<a name="Page_328"></a>the effort of altering them; "what he had done
once
he was wont, for that very reason, to continue doing."
A few days after Browning's death a journalist
obtained from a photographer, Mr Grove, who had
formerly been for seven years in Browning's service,
the particulars as to how an ordinary day during the
London season went by at Warwick Crescent. Browning
rose without fail at seven, enjoyed a plate of
whatever fruit&#8212;strawberries, grapes, oranges&#8212;were
in season; read, generally some piece of foreign
literature, for an hour in his bedroom; then bathed;
breakfasted&#8212;a light meal of twenty minutes; sat by
the fire and read his <i>Times</i> and <i>Daily News</i> till ten;
from ten to one wrote in his study or meditated with
head resting on his hand. To write a letter was the
reverse of a pleasure to him, yet he was diligent in
replying to a multitude of correspondents. His lunch,
at one, was of the lightest kind, usually no more than
a pudding. Visits, private views of picture exhibitions
and the like followed until half-past five. At seven
he dined, preferring Carlowitz or claret to other wines,
and drinking little of any. But on many days the
dinner was not at home; once during three successive
weeks he dined out without the omission of a day.
He returned home seldom at a later hour than half-past
twelve; and at seven next morning the round
began again. During his elder years, says Mr Grove,
he took little interest in politics. He was not often a
church-goer, but discussed religious matters earnestly
with his clerical friends. He loved not only animals but
flowers, and when once a Virginia creeper entered
the study window at Warwick Crescent, it was not
expelled but trained inside the room. To his
<a name="Page_329"></a>servants he was a considerate friend rather than
a
master.</p>
<p>So far Mr Grove as reported in the <i>Pall Mall
Gazette</i> (Dec 16, 1889).</p>
<p>Many persons have attempted to describe Browning
as he appeared in society; there is a consensus of
opinion as to the energy and cordiality of his way of
social converse; but it is singular that, though some
records of his out-pourings as a talker exist, very
little is on record that possesses permanent value.
Perhaps the best word that can be quoted is that
remembered by Sir James Paget&#8212;Browning's recommendation
of Bach's "Crucifixus&#8212;et sepultus&#8212;et
resurrexit" as a cure for want of belief. He did not
fling such pointed shafts as those of Johnson which
still hang and almost quiver where they struck. His
energy did not gather itself up into sentences but
flowed&#8212;and sometimes foamed&#8212;in a tide. Cordial
as he was, he could be also vehemently intolerant, and
sometimes perhaps where his acquaintance with the
subject of his discourse was not sufficient to warrant a
decided opinion.<a name="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a>
He appeared, says his biographer,
"more widely sympathetic in his works than in his
life"; with no moral selfishness he was, adds Mrs Orr,
intellectually self-centred; and unquestionably the
statement is correct. He could suffer fools, but not
always gladly. Speaking of earlier days in Italy, T.A.
Trollope observes that, while he was never rough
or discourteous even to the most exasperating fool,
"the men used to be rather afraid of Browning." His
cordiality was not insincere; but it belonged to his
<a name="Page_330"></a>outer, not his inner self. With the exception of
Milsand, he appears to have admitted no man to his
heart, though he gave a portion of his intellect to
many. His friends, in the more intimate sense of the
word, were women, towards whom his feeling was that
of comradeship and fraternal affection without over-much
condescension or any specially chivalric sentiment.
When early in their acquaintance Miss
Barrett promised Browning that he would find her
"an honest man on the whole," she understood her
correspondent, who valued a good comrade of the
other sex, and had at the same time a vivid sense of
the fact that such a comrade was not so unfortunate
as to be really a man.</p>
<p>Let witnesses be cited and each give his fragment of
evidence. Mr W.J. Stillman, an excellent observer, was
specially impressed in his intercourse with Browning,
by the mental health and robustness of a nature sound
to the core; "an almost unlimited intellectual vitality,
and an individuality which nothing could infringe on,
but which a singular sensitiveness towards others prevented
from ever wounding even the most morbid
sensibility; a strong man armed in the completest
defensive armour, but with no aggressiveness."<a name="FNanchor_122"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> A
writer in the first volume of <i>The New Review</i>,
described Browning as a talker in general society
so faithfully that it is impossible to improve on what
he has said: "It may safely be alleged," he writes,
"that no one meeting Mr Browning for the first time,
and unfurnished with a clue, would guess his vocation.
He might be a diplomatist, a statesman, a discoverer,
or a man of science. But, whatever were his calling,
<a name="Page_331"></a>we should feel that it must be essentially
practical....
His conversation corresponds to his appearance. It
abounds in vigour, in fire, in vivacity. Yet all the
time it is entirely free from mystery, vagueness, or
technical jargon. It is the crisp, emphatic and powerful
discourse of a man of the world, who is incomparably
better informed than the mass of his congeners. Mr
Browning is the readiest, the blithest, and the most
forcible of talkers. Like the Monsignore in <i>Lothair</i>
he can 'sparkle with anecdote and blaze with repartee,'
and when he deals in criticism the edge of his sword
is mercilessly whetted against pretension and vanity.
The inflection of his voice, the flash of his eye, the
pose of his head, the action of his hand, all lend their
special emphasis to the condemnation." The mental
quality which most impressed Mr W.M. Rossetti in
his communications with Browning was, he says,
"celerity "&#8212;"whatever he had to consider or speak
about, he disposed of in the most forthright
style." His method was of the greatest directness;
"every touch told, every nail was hit on the head."
He was not a sustained, continuous speaker, nor exactly
a brilliant one; "but he said something pleasant
and pointed on whatever turned up; ... one felt
his mind to be extraordinarily rich, while his facility,
accessibility, and <i>bonhomie</i>, softened but did not by
any means disguise the sense of his power."<a name="FNanchor_123"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> Browning's
discourse with a single person who was a favoured
acquaintance was, Mr Gosse declares, "a very much
finer phenomenon than when a group surrounded him."
Then "his talk assumed the volume and the tumult
<a name="Page_332"></a>of a cascade. His voice rose to a shout, sank to
a
whisper, ran up and down the gamut of conversational
melody.... In his own study or drawing-room,
what he loved was to capture the visitor in a low
arm-chair's "sofa-lap of leather", and from a most
unfair vantage of height to tyrannize, to walk round
the victim, in front, behind, on this side, on that,
weaving magic circles, now with gesticulating arms
thrown high, now grovelling on the floor to find some
reference in a folio, talking all the while, a redundant
turmoil of thoughts, fancies, and reminiscences flowing
from those generous lips."<a name="FNanchor_124"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>
<p>Mr Henry James in his "Life of Story"<a name="FNanchor_125"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> is less
pictorial, but he is characteristically subtle in his
rendering of the facts. He brings us back, however,
to Browning as seen in society. He speaks of the
Italian as a comparatively idyllic period which seemed
to be "built out," though this was not really the case,
by the brilliant London period. It was, he says, as
if Browning had divided his personal consciousness
into two independent compartments. The man of the
world "walked abroad, showed himself, talked, right
resonantly, abounded, multiplied his connections, did
his duty." The poet&#8212;an inscrutable personage&#8212;"sat
at home and knew, as well he might, in what
quarters of <i>that</i> sphere to look for suitable company."
"The poet and the 'member of society' were, in a
word, dissociated in him as they can rarely elsewhere
have been.... The wall that built out the idyll (as
we call it for convenience) of which memory and
imagination were virtually composed for him, stood
<a name="Page_333"></a>there behind him solidly enough, but subject to
his
privilege of living almost equally on both sides of it.
It contained an invisible door, through which, working
the lock at will, he could softly pass, and of which he
kept the golden key&#8212;carrying about the same with
him even in the pocket of his dinner waistcoat, yet
even in his most splendid expansions showing it, happy
man, to none." Tennyson, said an acquaintance of
Miss Anna Swanwick, "hides himself behind his
laurels, Browning behind the man of the world."
She declares that her experience was more fortunate;
that she seldom heard Browning speak without feeling
that she was listening to the poet, and that on more
than one occasion he spoke to her of his wife<a name="FNanchor_126"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a>. But
many witnesses confirm the impression which is so
happily put into words by Mr Henry James. The
"member of society" protected the privacy of the poet.
The questions remain whether the poet did not suffer
from such protection; whether, beside the superfluous
forces which might be advantageously disposed of at
the drawing-board or in thumping wet clay, some of
the forces proper to the poet were not drawn away
and dissipated by the incessant demands of Society;
whether while a sufficient fund of energy for the
double life was present with Browning, the peculiar
energy of the poet did not undergo a certain deterioration.
The doctrine of the superiority of the heart to
the intellect is more and more preached in Browning's
poetry; but the doctrine itself is an act of the intellect.
The poet need not perhaps insist on the doctrine if he
creates&#8212;as Browning did in earlier years&#8212;beautiful
<a name="Page_334"></a>things which commend themselves, without a
preacher,
to our love.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1878, after seventeen years of
absence from Italy, Browning was recaptured by its
charm, and henceforward to the close of his life Venice
and the Venetian district became his accustomed place
of summer refreshment and repose. For a time, with
his sister as his companion, he paused at a hotel near
the summit of the Spl&uuml;gen, enjoyed the mountain air,
walked vigorously, and wrote, with great rapidity, says
Mrs Orr, his poem of Russia, <i>Iv&agrave;n Iv&agrave;novitch</i>.
When
a boy he had read in Bunyan's "Life and Death of
Mr Badman" the story of "Old Tod", and with this
still vivid in his memory, he added to his Russian tale
the highly unidyllic "idyl" of English life, <i>Ned Bratts</i>.
It was thus that subjects for poems suddenly presented
themselves to Browning, often rising up as it were
spontaneously out of the remote past. "There comes
up unexpectedly," he wrote in a letter to a friend,
"some subject for poetry, which has been dormant,
and apparently dead, for perhaps dozens of years. A
month since I wrote a poem of some two hundred
lines ['Donald'] about a story I heard more than
forty years ago, and never dreamed of trying to repeat,
wondering how it had so long escaped me; and so it
has been with my best things."<a name="FNanchor_127"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> Before the close of
September the travellers were in a rough but pleasant
albergo at Asolo, which Browning had not seen since
his first Italian journey more than forty years previously.
"Such things," he writes, "have begun and
ended with me in the interval!" Changes had taken
<a name="Page_335"></a>place in the little city; yet much seemed
familiar and
therefore the more dreamlike. The place had indeed
haunted him in his dreams; he would find himself
travelling with a friend, or some mysterious stranger,
when suddenly the little town sparkling in the sunshine
would rise before him. "Look! look there is
Asolo," he would cry, "do let us go there!" And
always, after the way of dreams, his companions would
declare it impossible and he would be hurried away.<a
 name="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a>
From the time that he actually saw again the city
that he loved this recurring dream was to come no
more. He wandered through the well-known places,
and seeking for an echo in the Rocca, the ruined
fortress above the town, he found that it had not lost
its tongue. A fortnight at Venice in a hotel where
quiet and coolness were the chief attractions, prepared
the way for many subsequent visits to what he afterwards
called "the dearest place in the world." Everything
in Venice, says Mrs Bronson, charmed him:
"He found grace and beauty in the <i>popolo</i> whom he
paints so well in the Goldoni sonnet. The poorest
street children were pretty in his eyes. He would
admire a carpenter or a painter, who chanced to be at
work in the house, and say to me 'See the fine poise
of the head ... those well-cut features. You might
fancy that man in the crimson robe of a Senator as
you see them in Tintoret's canvas.'"</p>
<p>But these are reminiscences of later days. It was
in 1880 that Browning made the acquaintance of
his American friend Mrs Arthur Bronson, whose kind
hospitalities added to the happiness of his visits to
<a name="Page_336"></a>Asolo and to Venice, who received, as if it were
a
farewell gift, the dedication of his last volume, and
who, not long before her death in 1901, published
interesting articles on "Browning in Asolo" and
"Browning in Venice" in <i>The Century Magazine</i>.
The only years in which he did not revisit Venice
were 1882, 1884 and 1886, and in each of these years
his absence was occasioned by some unforeseen mis-adventure.
In 1882 the floods were out, and he
proceeded no farther than Verona. Could he have
overcome the obstacles and reached Venice, he feared
that he might have been incapable of enjoying it.
For the first time in his life he was lamed by what
he took for an attack of rheumatism, "caught," he says,
"just before leaving St Pierre de Chartreuse, through
my stupid inadvertence in sitting with a window open
at my back&#8212;reading the Iliad, all my excuse!&#8212;while
clad in a thin summer suit, and snow on the hills and
bitterness every where."<a name="FNanchor_129"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> In 1884 his sister's illness
at first forbade travel to so considerable a distance.
The two companions were received by another
American friend, Mrs Bloomfield Moore, at the Villa
Berry, St Moritz, and when she was summoned across
the Atlantic, at her request they continued to occupy
her villa. The season was past; the place deserted;
but the sun shone gloriously. "We have walked
every day," Browning wrote at the end of September,
"morning and evening&#8212;afternoon I should say&#8212;two
or three hours each excursion, the delicious mountain
air surpassing any I was ever privileged to breathe.
My sister is absolutely herself again, and something
over: I was hardly in want of such doctor<a name="Page_337"></a>ing."<a
 name="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a>
Two years later Miss Browning was ailing again,
and they did not venture farther than Wales. At the
Hand Hotel, Llangollen, they were at no great distance
from Brintysilio, the summer residence of their friends Sir
Theodore and Lady Martin&#8212;in earlier days the Lady
Carlisle and Colombe of Browning's plays.<a name="FNanchor_131"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> Mrs Orr
notices that Browning, Liberal as he declared himself,
was now very favourably impressed by the services to
society of the English country gentleman. "Talk of
abolishing that class of men!" he exclaimed, "they
are the salt of the earth!" She adds, as worthy of
remark, that he attended regularly the afternoon
Sunday service in the parish church at Llantysilio,
where now a tablet of Lady Martin's placing marks
the spot. Churchgoing was not his practice in
London; "but I do not think," says Mrs Orr, "he
ever failed in it at the Universities or in the country."
At Venice it was his custom to be present with his
sister at the services of a Waldensian chapel, where
"a certain eloquent pastor," as Mrs Bronson describes
him, was the preacher. A year before his death
Browning in a letter to Lady Martin recalls the
happy season in the Vale of Llangollen&#8212;"delightful
weeks&#8212;each tipped with a sweet starry Sunday at the
little church leading to the House Beautiful where we
took our rest of an evening spent always memorably."</p>

<h5>THE PALAZZO GIUSTINIANI, VENICE.</h5>
<h5><i>From a drawing by</i> Miss N. ERICHSEN.</h5>
<p>Before passing on to Venice, where repose was
mingled with excitement, Browning was accustomed
to seek a renewal of physical energy, after the fatigues
of London, in some place not too much haunted by
<a name="Page_338"></a>the English tourist, where he could walk for
hours in
the clear mountain air. In 1881 and 1882 it was St
Pierre de Chartreuse, from which he visited the Grande
Chartreuse, and heard the midnight mass; in 1883
and 1885 it was Gressoney St Jean in the Val d'Aosta&#8212;the
"delightful Gressoney" of the Prologue to
<i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i>, where "eggs, milk, cheese, fruit"
sufficed "for gormandizing"; in 1888 it was the yet
more beautiful Primiero, near Feltre. In the previous
year he had, for the second time, stayed at St Moritz.
These were seasons of abounding life. St Pierre was
only "a wild little clump of cottages on a mountain
amid loftier mountains," with the roughest of little inns
for its hotel; but its primitive arrangements suited
Browning well and were bravely borne by his sister.<a
 name="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a>
From Gressoney in September 1885 he wrote: "We
are all but alone, the brief 'season' being over, and
only a chance traveller turning up for a fortnight's
lodging. We take our walks in the old way; two and
a half hours before breakfast, three after it, in the
most beautiful country I know. Yesterday the three
hours passed without our meeting a single man,
woman, or child; one man only was discovered at a
distance at the foot of a mountain we had climbed."<a
 name="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a>
All things pleased him; an August snowstorm at St
Moritz was made amends for by "the magnificence of
the mountain and its firs black against the universal
white"; it served moreover as an illustration of a
passage in the Iliad, the only book that accompanied
him from England: "The days glide away uneventfully,
<i>nearly</i>, and I breathe in the pleasant idleness at every
<a name="Page_339"></a>pore. I have no few acquaintances here&#8212;nay, some
old friends&#8212;but my intimates are the firs on the hillside,
and the myriad butterflies all about it, every
bright wing of them under the snow to-day, which
ought not to have been for a fortnight yet."<a name="FNanchor_134"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> And
from Primiero in 1888, when his strength had considerably
declined, a letter tells of unabated pleasure;
of mountains "which morning and evening, in turn,
transmute literally to gold," with at times a silver
change; of the valley "one green luxuriance"; of the
tiger-lilies in the garden above ten feet high, every
bloom and every leaf faultless; and of the captive
fox, "most engaging of little vixens," who, to Browning's
great joy, broke her chain and escaped.<a name="FNanchor_135"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> As each
successive volume that he published seemed to him
his best, so of his mountain places of abode the
last always was the loveliest.</p>
<p>At Venice for a time the quiet Albergo dell'
Universo suited Browning and his sister well, but
when Mrs Bronson pressed them to accept the use
of a suite of rooms in the Palazzo Giustiniani Recanati
and the kind offer was accepted, the gain was
considerable; and the <i>Palazzo</i> has historical associations
dating from the fifteenth century which pleased
Browning's imagination. It was his habit to rise early,
and after a light breakfast to visit the Public Gardens
with his sister. He had many friends&#8212;Mrs Bronson
is our informant&#8212;whose wants or wishes he bore in
mind&#8212;the prisoned elephant, the baboon, the kangaroo,
the marmosets, the pelicans, the ostrich; three times,
<a name="Page_340"></a>with strict punctuality, he made his rounds, and
then
returned to his apartment. At noon appeared the
second and more substantial breakfast, at which Italian
dishes were preferred. Browning wrote passionately
against the vivisection of animals, and strenuously
declaimed against the decoration of a lady's hat with
the spoils of birds&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Clothed with murder of His best<br />
</span><span>Of harmless beings.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>He praised God&#8212;for pleasure as he teaches us is
praise&#8212;by heartily enjoying ortolans, "a dozen
luscious lumps" provided by the cook of the
Giustiniani-Recanati palace; to vary his own phrasing,
he was</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Fed with murder of His best<br />
</span><span>Of harmless beings,<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>and laughed, innocently enough, with his good sister
over the delicious "mouthfuls for cardinals."<a name="FNanchor_136"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> As if
the pleasure of the eye in beauty gained at a bird's
expense were more criminal than the gusto of the
tongue in lusciousness, curbed by piquancy, gained at
the expense of a dozen other birds! At three o'clock
came the gondola, and it was often directed to the
Lido. "I walk, even in wind and rain, for a couple
of hours on Lido," Browning wrote when nearly
seventy, "and enjoy the break of sea on the strip of
sand as much as Shelley did in those old days."<a name="FNanchor_137"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a>
And to another friend: "You don't know how absolutely
well I am after my walking, not on the
mountains merely, but on the beloved Lido. Go there,
<a name="Page_341"></a>if only to stand and be blown about by the sea
wind."<a name="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a>
At one time he even talked of completing an unfinished
villa on the Lido from which "the divine sunsets"
could be seen, but the dream-villa faded after the
manner of such dreams. Sunsets, however, and sunrises
never faded from Browning's brain. "I will not
praise a cloud however bright," says Wordsworth,
although no one has praised them more ardently than
he. From Pippa's sunrise to the sunrises of mornings
when his life drew towards its close, Browning lavished
his praise upon the scenery of the sky. A passage
quoted by Mrs Orr from a letter written a little more
than a year before his death is steeped in colour; when
<i>Pippa Passes</i> becomes the prey of the annotating
editor it will illuminate his page: "Every morning at
six I see the sun rise.... My bedroom window
commands a perfect view: the still, grey lagune, the
few sea-gulls flying, the islet of S. Giorgio in deep
shadow, and the clouds in a long purple rack, behind
which a sort of spirit of rose burns up till presently
all the rims are on fire with gold, and last of all the
orb sends before it a long column of its own essence
apparently: so my day begins." The sea-gulls of
which this extract speaks were, Mrs Bronson tells us,
a special delight to Browning. On a day of gales
"he would stand at the window and watch them as
they sailed to and fro, a sure sign of heavy storms in
the Adriatic." To him, as he declared, they were
even more interesting than the doves of St Mark.</p>
<p>Sometimes his walks, guided by Mrs Bronson's
daughter, "the best cicerone in the world," he said, were
through the narrowest by-streets of the city, where he
<a name="Page_342"></a>rejoiced in the discovery, or what he supposed
to be
discovery, of some neglected stone of Venice. Occasionally
he examined curiously the monuments of the
churches. His American friend tells at length the
story of a search in the Church of San Niccol&ograve; for the
tomb of the chieftain Salinguerra of Browning's own
<i>Sordello</i>. At times he entered the bric-a-brac shops,
and made a purchase of some piece of old furniture or
tapestry. His rule "never to buy anything without
knowing exactly what he wished to do with it" must
have been interpreted liberally, for when about to move
in June 1887 from Warwick Crescent to De Vere
Gardens many treasures acquired in Italy were, Mrs
Orr tells us, stowed away in the house which he was
on the point of leaving. And the latest bibelot was
always the most enchanting: "Like a child with a
new toy," says Mrs Bronson, "he would carry it himself
(size and weight permitting) into the gondola,
rejoice over his chance in finding it, and descant
eloquently upon its intrinsic merits." Thus, or with his
son's assistance, came to De Vere Gardens brass lamps
that had hung in Venetian chapels, the silver Jewish
"Sabbath lamp," and the "four little heads"&#8212;the
seasons&#8212;after which, Browning declared, he would not
buy another thing for the house.<a name="FNanchor_139"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> Returning from his
walks on the Lido or wanderings through the little
<i>calli</i>, he showed that unwise half-disdain, which an
unenlightened
masculine Herakles might have shown, for
the blessedness of five o'clock tea. At dinner he was
in his toilet what Mr Henry James calls the "member
of society," never the poet whose necktie is a dithyramb.
Good sense was his habit if not his foible.
<a name="Page_343"></a>And why should we deny ourselves here the
pleasure
of imagining Miss Browning at these pleasant ceremonies,
as Mrs Bronson describes her, wearing "beautiful
gowns of rich and sombre tints, and appearing each
day in a different and most dainty French cap and
quaint antique jewels"? If other guests were not
present, sometimes a visit to the theatre followed.
The Venetian comedies of Gallina especially pleased
Browning; he went to his spacious box at the Goldoni
evening after evening, and did not fail to express his
thanks to his "brother dramatist" for the enjoyment
he had received. In his <i>Toccata of Galuppi</i> he had
expressed the melancholy which underlies the transitory
gaiety of eighteenth-century life in Venice; but he
could also remember its innocent gladnesses without this
sense of melancholy. When in 1883 the committee
of the Goldoni monument asked Browning to contribute
a poem to their Album he immediately complied with
the request. It was "scribbled off," according to
Mrs Orr, while Professor Molmenti's messenger was
waiting; it was ready the day after the request reached
him, says Mrs Bronson, and was probably "carefully
thought out before he put pen to paper." It catches,
in the happiest temper, the spirit of Goldoni's sunniest
plays:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>There throng the People: how they come and go,<br />
</span><span>Lisp the soft language, flaunt the bright garb&#8212;see&#8212;<br />
</span><span>On Piazza, Calle, under Portico<br />
</span><span>And over Bridge! Dear King of Comedy,<br />
</span><span>Be honoured! Thou that didst love Venice so,<br />
</span><span>Venice, and we who love her, all love thee!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The brightness and lightness of southern life soothed
Browning's northern strenuousness of mood. He would
<a name="Page_344"></a>enumerate of a morning the crimes of "the wicked
city"
as revealed by the reports of the public press&#8212;a
gondolier's oars had been conveyed away, a piece of
linen a-dry had corrupted the virtue of some lightfingered
Autolycus of the canals!<a name="FNanchor_140"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> Yet all the while
much of his heart remained with his native land. He
could not be happy without his London daily paper;
Mrs Orr tells us how deeply interested he was in the
fortunes of the British expedition for the relief of
General Gordon.</p>
<p>In 1885 Browning's son for the first time since his
childhood was in Italy. With Venice he was in his
father's phrase "simply infatuated." For his son's sake,
but also with the thought of a place of retreat when
perhaps years should bring with them feebleness of
body, Browning entered into treaty with the owner, an
Austrian and an absentee, for the purchase of the
Manzoni Palazzo on the Grand Canal. He considered
it the most beautiful house in Venice. Ruskin had
described it in the "Stones of Venice" as "a perfect
and very rich example of Byzantine Renaissance." It
wholly captured the imagination of Browning. He not
only already possessed it in his dream, but was busy
opening new windows to admit the morning sunshine,
and throwing out balconies, while leaving undisturbed
the rich fa&ccedil;ade with its medallions in coloured marble.
The dream was never realised. The vendor, Marchese
Montecucculi, hoping to secure a higher price, drew
back. Browning was about to force him by legal proceedings
to fulfil his bargain, when it was discovered
that the walls were cracked and the foundations were
untrustworthy. To his great mortification the whole
<a name="Page_345"></a>scheme had to be abandoned. It was not until his
son in 1888, the year after his marriage, acquired
possession of the Palazzo Rezzonico&#8212;"a stately temple
of the rococo" is Mr Henry James's best word for it&#8212;that
Browning ceased to think with regret of the lost
Manzoni. At no time, however, did he design a voluntary
abandonment of his life in England. When in
full expectation of becoming the owner of the Palazzo
Manzoni he wrote to Dr Furnivall: "Don't think I
mean to give up London till it warns me away; when
the hospitalities and innumerable delights grow a
burden.... Pen will have sunshine and beauty about
him, and every help to profit by these, while I and my
sister have secured a shelter when the fogs of life grow
too troublesome."</p>

<h2><a name="Page_346"></a>Chapter XVI</h2>
<h2>Poet and Teacher in Old Age</h2>
<br />
<p>During the last decade of his life Browning's influence
as a literary power was assured. The publication
indeed of <i>The Ring and the Book</i> in 1868 did much
to establish his reputation with those readers who are
not watchers for a new planet but revise their astronomical
charts upon authority. He noted with satisfaction
that fourteen hundred copies of <i>Prince
Hohenstiel-Schwangau</i> were sold in five days, and
says of <i>Balaustion's Adventure</i> "2500 in five months
is a good sale for the likes of me." The later volumes
were not perhaps more popular, but they sent readers
to the earlier poems, and successive volumes of Selections
made these easily accessible. That published by
Moxon in 1865, and dedicated in words of admiration
and friendship to Tennyson, by no means equalled in
value the earlier Selections made by John Forster. The
volume of 1872&#8212;dedicated also to Tennyson&#8212;which
has been frequently reprinted, was arranged upon a
principle, the reference of which to the poems chosen
is far from clear&#8212;"by simply stringing together certain
pieces"; Browning wrote, "on the thread of an imaginary
personality, I present them in succession, rather
as the natural development of a particular experience
than because I account them the most noteworthy
portion of my work." We can perceive that some
<a name="Page_347"></a>poems of love are brought together, and some of
art,
and that the series closes with poems of religious thought
or experience, but such an order is not strictly observed,
and the "imaginary personality"&#8212;the thread&#8212;seems
to be imaginary in the fullest sense of the word. Yet
it is of interest to observe that something of a psychological-dramatic
arrangement was at least designed.
A second series of Selections followed in 1880. Browning
was accepted by many admirers not only as a poet
but as a prophet. "Tennyson and I seem now to be
regarded as the two kings of Brentford," he said
laughingly in 1879.<a name="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a>
The later-enthroned king was
soon to have an interesting court. In 1881 The
Browning Society, founded by Dr Furnivall&#8212;initiator
of so much work that is invaluable to the student of
our literature&#8212;and Miss E.H. Hickey, herself a poet,
began its course. At first, according to Mrs Orr,
Browning "treated the project as a joke," but when
once he understood it to be serious, "he did not oppose
it." He felt, however, that before the public he must
stand aloof from its work: "as Wilkes was no Wilkeite,"
he wrote to Edmund Yates, "I am quite other than a
Browningite." With a little nervousness as to the
discretion which the Society might or might not show,
he felt grateful for the interest in his writings demonstrated
by persons many of whom had been unknown
to him even by name. He was always ready to furnish
Dr Furnivall with a note of facts or elucidation. His
old admirers had made him somewhat too much of
a peculiar and private possession. A propaganda of
younger believers could not be unwelcome to one
who had for so many years been commonly regarded
<a name="Page_348"></a>as an obscure heretic&#8212;not even an heresiarch&#8212;of
literature.</p>
<p>Other honours accompanied his old age. In 1884
he received the LL.D. of the University of Edinburgh,
and again declined to be nominated for the Lord
Rectorship of the University of St Andrews. Next
year he accepted the Honorary Presidency of the Five
Associated Societies of Edinburgh. In 1886 he
was appointed Foreign Correspondent to the Royal
Academy, a sinecure post rendered vacant by the
death of Lord Houghton. Though so vigorous in
talk, Browning could not make a public speech, or
he shrank from such an effort; none of the honours
which he accepted were such as to put him to this test.
During many years he was President of the New
Shakspere Society. His veneration for Shakespeare
is expressed in a sonnet entitled <i>The Names</i>, written
for the Book of the Show held in the Albert Hall,
May 1884, on behalf of the Fulham Road Hospital
for Women; it was not included in the edition of his
works which he was superintending during the last
two years of his life. Browning was not wholly
uninterested in the attempts made to transfer the
glory of the Shakespearian drama to Bacon; he
agreed with Spedding that whatever else might be
a matter of doubt, it was certain that the author of
the "Essays" could not have been the author of the
plays. On another question it is perhaps worth recording
his opinion&#8212;he could see nothing of Shakespeare,
he declared, in the tragedy of <i>Titus Andronicus</i>.</p>
<p>In 1879 appeared <i>Dramatic Idyls</i> and in the
following year <i>Dramatic Idyls, Second Series</i>. They
differed in two respects from the volumes of mis<a name="Page_349"></a>cellaneous
poetry which Browning had previously
published. Hitherto the contents of his collections of
verse in the main fell into three groups&#8212;poems which
were interpretations of the passion of love, poems which
dealt with art and artists, poems which were inspired
by the ideas and emotions of religion. Unless we
regard <i>Ned Bratts</i> as a poem of religious experience,
we may say that these themes are wholly absent from
the <i>Dramatic Idyls</i>. Secondly, the short story in verse
for the first time becomes predominant, or rather
excludes other forms, and the short story here is in
general not romantic or fantastic, but what we understand
by the word "realistic." The outward body of
the story is in several instances more built up by
cumulative details than formerly, which gives it an
air of solidity or massiveness, and is less expressed
through a swift selection of things essential. And
this may lead a reader to suppose that the story is
more a narrative of external incidents than is actually
the case. In truth, though the "corporal rind" of the
narrative bulks upon our view, the poet remains
essentially the psychologist. The narrative interest is
not evenly distributed over the whole as it is in the
works of such a writer as Chaucer, who loves narrative
for its own sake. There is ordinarily a crisis, a
culmination, a decisive and eventful invasion or outbreak
of spiritual passion to which we are led up by
all that precedes it. If the poem should be humorous,
it works up to some humorous point, or surprise. The
narrative is in fact a picture that hangs from a nail,
and the nail here is some vivid moment of spiritual
experience, or else some jest which also has its crisis.
A question sometimes arises as to whether the central
<a name="Page_350"></a>motive is sufficient to bear the elaborate
apparatus;
for the parts of the poem do not always justify
themselves except by reference to their centre, in
the case, for example, of <i>Doctor</i>&#8212;&#8212;, the thesis is that
a bad wife is stronger than death; the jest culminates
at the point where the Devil upon sight of his formidable
spouse flies from the bed's-head of one who is
about to die, and thus allows his victim to escape the
imminent death. The question, "Will the jest sustain
a poem of such length?" is a fair one, and a good-natured
reader will stretch a point and say that he
has not after all been so ill amused, which he might
also say of an Ingoldsby Legend; but even a good-natured
reader will hardly return to <i>Doctor</i> &#8212;&#8212; with
pleasure. Chaucer with as thin a jest could have
made an admirable poem, for the interest would have
been distributed by his lightness of touch, by his
descriptive power, by slyness, by geniality, by a
changeful ripple of enjoyment over the entire piece.
With Browning, when we have arrived at the apex of
the jest, we are fatigued by the climb, and too much
out of breath to be capable of laughter. In like
manner few persons except the Browning enthusiast,
who is not responsible for his fervour, will assert that
either the jest or the frankly cynical moral of <i>Pietro
of Abano</i> compensates for the jolting in a springless
waggon over a rough road and a long. We make the
acquaintance of a magician who with knowledge uninspired
by love has kicks and cuffs for his reward, and
the acquaintance of an astute Greek, who, at least in
his dream of life, imposed upon him by the art of magic,
exploits the talents of his friend Pietro, and gains the
prize of his astuteness, having learnt to rule men by
<a name="Page_351"></a>the potent spell of "cleverness uncurbed by
conscience."
The cynicism is only inverted morality, and implies
that the writer is the reverse of cynical; but it lacks
the attractive sub-acid flavour of a delicate cynicism,
which insinuates its prophylactic virus into our veins,
and the humour of the poem, ascending from stage to
stage until we reach Pietro's final failure, is cumbrous
and mechanical.</p>
<p>The two series of <i>Dramatic Idyls</i> included some conspicuous
successes. The classical poems <i>Pheidippides</i>,
<i>Echetlos</i>, <i>Pan and Luna</i>, idyls heroic and mythological,
invite us by their beauty to return to them again and
again. Browning's sympathy with gallantry in action,
with self-devotion to a worthy cause, was never more
vividly rendered than in the first of these poems.
The runner of Athens is a more graceful brother of
the Breton sailor who saved a fleet for France; but
the vision of majestical Pan in "the cool of a cleft"
exalts our human heroism into relation with the divine
benevolence, and the reward of release from labour is
proportionally higher than a holiday with the "belle
Aurore." Victory and then domestic love is the
human interpretation of Pan's oracular promise; but
the gifts of the gods are better than our hopes and it
proves to be victory and death:</p>

<p>The companion poem of Marathon, the story of the
nameless clown, the mysterious holder of the ploughshare,
is not less inspiring. The unknown champion,
<a name="Page_352"></a>so plain in his heroic magnitude of mind, so
brilliant
as he flashes in the van, in the rear, is like the incarnated
genius of the soil, which hides itself in the
furrow and flashes into the harvest; and it is his glory
to be obscured for ever by his deed&#8212;"the great
deed ne'er grows small." Browning's development
of the Vergilian myth&#8212;"si credere dignum est"&#8212;of
Pan and Luna astonishes by its vehement sensuousness
and its frank chastity; and while the beauty of the
Girl-moon and the terror of her betrayal are realised
with the utmost energy of imagination, we are made to
feel that all which happens is the transaction of a
significant dream or legend.</p>
<p>In contrast with these classical pieces, <i>Halbert and
Hob</i> reads like a fragment from some Scandinavian
saga telling of the life of forlorn and monstrous
creatures, cave-dwellers, who are less men than beasts.
Yet father and son are indeed men; the remorse which
checks the last outrage against paternity is the touch
of the finger of God upon human hearts; and though
old Halbert sits dead,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>With an outburst blackening still the old bad
fighting face,<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>and young Hob henceforth goes tottering, muttering,
mumbling with a mindless docility, they are, like
Browning's men of the Paris morgue, only "apparent
failures"; there was in them that spark of divine
illumination which can never be wholly extinguished.
Positive misdeeds, the presence of a wild crew of evil
passions, do not suffice to make Browning's faith or
hope falter. It is the absence of human virtue which
appals him; if the salt have lost its savour wherewith
shall it be salted? This it is which condemns to a
<a name="Page_353"></a>swift, and what the poem represents as a just,
abolishment
from earth the mother who in <i>Iv&agrave;n Iv&agrave;novitch</i>
has given her children to the wolves, and has thereby
proved the complete nullity of her womanhood. For
her there is no possible redemption; she must cease to
cumber the ground. Iv&agrave;n acts merely as the instinctive
doomsman of Nature or of God, and the old village
Pope, who, as the veil of life grows thin, is feeling after
the law above human law, justifies the wielder of the
axe, which has been no instrument of vengeance but
simply an exponent of the wholesome vitality of earth.
The objection that carpenters and joiners, who assume
the Heraklean task of purging the earth of monsters,
must be prepared to undergo a period of confinement
at the pleasure of the Czar in a Criminal Lunatic
Asylum is highly sensible, and wholly inappropriate,
belonging, as it does, to a plane of thought and feeling
other than that in which the poem moves. But perhaps
it is not a defect of feeling to fail in admiration of that
admired final tableau in which the formidable carpenter
is discovered building a toy Kremlin for his five
children. We can take for granted that the excellent
homicide, having done so simple a bit of the day's
work as that of decapitating a fellow-creature, proceeds
tranquilly to other innocent pleasures and duties; we
do not require the ostentatious theatrical group, with
limelight effects on the Kremlin and the honey-coloured
beard, displayed for our benefit just before the curtain
is rung down.<a name="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>

</p>
<h5>SPECIMEN OF BROWNING'S HANDWRITING.</h5>
<h5><i>From a letter to D.S. CURTIS, Esq.</i></h5>
<p><a name="Page_354"></a><i>Martin Relph</i> is a story of life-long
remorse, self-condemnation
and self-denunciation; there is something
approaching the supernatural, and yet terribly
real, in the figure of the strange old man with a beard
as white as snow, standing, on a bright May day, in
monumental grief, and exposing his ulcerated heart to
the spectators who form for him a kind of posterity.
One instant's failure in the probation of life, one
momentary syncope of his better nature long years
ago, has condemned his whole after-existence to become
a climbing of the purgatorial mount, with an
agony of pain annually renewed at the season when
the earth rejoices. Only a high-strung delicate spirit
is capable of such a perennial passion of penitence.
<i>Ned Bratts</i> may be described as a companion, but a
contrasted piece. It is a story of sudden conversion
and of penitence taking an immediate and highly
effective form. The humour of the poem, which is
excellent of its kind, resembles more the humour of
Rowlandson than that of Hogarth. The Bedford
Court House on the sweltering Midsummer Day, the
Puritan recusants, reeking of piety and the cow-house
conventicle, the Judges at high jinks upon the bench&#8212;to
whom, all in a muck-sweat and ablaze with the
fervour of conversion, enter Black Ned, the stout
publican, and big Tab, his slut of a wife,&#8212;these are
drawn after the broad British style of humorous
illustration, which combines a frank exaggeration of
the characteristic lines with, at times, a certain grace
in deformity. Here at least is downright belief in the
<a name="Page_355"></a>invisible, here is genuine conviction driven
home by
the Spirit of God and the terror of hell-fire. Black
Ned and the slut Tabby as yet may not seem the
most suitable additions to the company of the blessed
who move singing</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>In solemn troops and sweet societies;<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>but when a pair of lusty sinners desire nothing so
much as to be hanged, and that forthwith, we may
take it that they are resolved, as "Christmas" was, to
quit the City of Destruction; and the saints above
have learnt not to be fastidious as they bend over
repentant rogues. Thanks to the grace of God and
John Bunyan's book, husband and wife triumphantly
aspire to and attain the gallows; "they were lovely and
pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were
not divided." A wise economy of spiritual force!&#8212;for
while their effectual calling cannot be gainsaid, the
final perseverance of these interesting converts, had
they lingered on the pilgrims' way, as Ned is painfully
aware, might have been less of a certainty.</p>
<p>Browning's method as a story-teller may be studied
with special advantage in <i>Clive</i>. The circumstances
under which the tale is related have to be caught at
by the reader, which quickens his attention and keeps
him on the alert; this device is, of course, not in itself
difficult, but to employ it with success is an achievement
requiring skill; it is a device proper to the dramatic
or quasi-dramatic form; the speaker, who is by no
means a Clive, has to betray something of his own
character, and at the same time to set forth the character
of the hero of his tale; the narrative must tend to a
moment of culmination, a crisis; and that this should
<a name="Page_356"></a>involve a paradox&#8212;Clive's fear, in the present
instance,
being not that the antagonist's pistol, presented at his
head, should be discharged but rather that it should be
remorsefully or contemptuously flung away&#8212;gives the
poet an opportunity for some subtle or some passionate
casuistry. The effect of the whole is that of a stream
or a shock from an electric battery of mind, for which
the story serves as a conductor. It is not a simple but
a highly complex species of narrative. In <i>Mul&eacute;ykeh</i>,
one of the most delightful of Browning's later poems,
uniting, as it does, the poetry of the rapture of swift
motion with the poetry of high-hearted passion, the
narrative leads up to a supreme moment, and this
resolves itself through a paradox of the heart. Shall
H&oacute;seyn recover his stolen Pearl of a steed, but recover
her dishonoured in the race, or abandon her to the
captor with her glory untarnished? It is he himself
who betrays himself to loss and grief, for to perfect
love, pride in the supremacy of the beloved is more
than possession; and thus as Clive's fear was courage,
as Ivan's violation of law was obedience to law, so
H&oacute;seyn's loss is H&oacute;seyn's gain. In each case Browning's
casuistry is not argumentative; it lies in an
appeal to some passion or some intuition that is above
our common levels of passion or of insight, and his
power of uplifting his reader for even a moment into
this higher mood is his special gift as a poet. We can
return safely enough to the common ground, but we
return with a possession which instructs the heart.</p>
<p>A mood of acquiescence, which does not displace
the moods of aspiration and of combat but rather
floats above them as an atmosphere, was growing
familiar to Browning in these his elder years. He had
<a name="Page_357"></a>sought for truth, and had now found all that
earth was
likely to yield him, of which not the least important
part was a conviction that much of our supposed
knowledge ends in a perception of our ignorance.
He was now disposed to accept what seemed to be
the providential order that truth and error should
mingle in our earthly life, that truth should be served
by illusion; he would not rearrange the disposition
of things if he could. He was inclined to hold by the
simple certainties of our present life and to be content
with these as provisional truths, or as temporary
illusions which lead on towards the truth. In the
<i>Pisgah Sights</i> of the <i>Pacchiarotto</i> volume he had
imagined this mood of acquiescence as belonging to
the hour of death. But old age in reality is an earlier
stage in the process of dying, and with all his ardour
and his energy, Browning was being detached from the
contentions and from some of the hopes and aspirations
of life. And because he was detached he could
take the world to his heart, though in a different
temper from that of youth or middle age; he could
limit his view to things that are near, because their
claim upon his passions had diminished while their
claim upon his tenderness had increased. He could
smile amiably, for to the mood of acquiescence a smile
seems to be worth more than an argument. He could
recall the thoughts of love, and reanimate them in his
imagination, and could love love with the devotion of
an old man to the most precious of the things that
have been. Some of an old man's jests may be found
in <i>Jocoseria</i>, some of an old man's imaginative passion
in <i>Asolando</i>, and in both volumes, and still more clearly
in <i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i> may be seen an old man's spirit
<a name="Page_358"></a>of acquiescence, or to use a catch-word of
Matthew
Arnold, the epoch of concentration which follows an
epoch of expansion. But the embrace of earth and
the things of earth is like the embrace, with a pathos
in its ardour, which precedes a farewell. From the
first he had recognised the danger on the one hand of
settling down to browse contentedly in the paddock of
our earthly life, and on the other hand the danger of
ignoring our limitations, the danger of attempting to
"thrust in earth eternity's concerns." In his earlier
years he had chiefly feared the first of these two
dangers, and even while pointing out, as in <i>Paracelsus</i>,
the errors of the seeker for absolute knowledge or for
absolute love, he had felt a certain sympathy with such
glorious transgressors. He had valued more than any
positive acquisitions of knowledge those "grasps of
guess, which pull the more into the less." Now such
guesses, such hopes were as precious to him as ever,
but he set more store than formerly by the certainties&#8212;certainties
even if illusions&#8212;of the general heart of
man. These are the forms of thought and feeling
divinely imposed upon us; we cannot do better than
to accept them; but we must accept them only as
provisional, as part of our education on earth, as a
needful rung of the ladder by which we may climb to
higher things. And the faith which leads to such
acquiescence also results in the acceptance of hopes as
things not be struggled for but rested in as a substantial
portion of the divine order of our lives. In autumn
come for spirits rightly attuned these pellucid halcyon
days of the Indian summer.</p>
<p>In <i>Jocoseria</i>, which appeared in Browning's seventy-first
year (1883), he shows nothing of his boisterous
<a name="Page_359"></a>humour, but smiles at our human infirmities from
the
heights of experience. The prop of Israel, the much-enlightened
master, "Eximious Jochanan Ben Sabbathai,"
when his last hour is at hand has to confess
that all his wisdom of life lies in his theoric; in
practice he is still an infant; striving presumptuously
in boyhood to live an angel, now that he comes to
die he is hardly a man. And Solomon himself is no
more than man; the truth-compelling ring extorts
the confession that an itch of vanity still tickles and
teazes him; the Queen of Sheba, seeker for wisdom
and patroness of culture, after all likes wisdom best
when its exponents are young men tall and proper,
and prefers to the solution of the riddles of life by
elderly monarchs one small kiss from a fool. Lilith
in a moment of terror acknowledges that her dignified
reserve was the cloak of passion, and Eve acknowledges
that her profession of love was transferred to the
wrong man; both ladies recover their self-possession
and resume their make-believe decorums, and Adam,
like a gallant gentleman, will not see through what is
transparent. These are harmless jests at the ironies
of life. Browning's best gifts in this volume, that
looks pale beside its predecessors, are one or two
short lyrics of love, which continue the series of his
latest lyrical poems, begun in the exquisite prologue
to <i>La Saisiaz</i> and the graceful epilogue to <i>The Two
Poets of Croisic</i>, and continued in the songs of
<i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i> and <i>Asolando</i>&#8212;not the least
valuable part of the work of his elder years. His
strength in this volume of 1883 is put into that
protest of human righteousness against immoral conceptions
of the Deity uttered by Ixion from his wheel
<a name="Page_360"></a>of torture. Rather than obey an immoral supreme
Power, as John Stuart Mill put it, "to Hell I will go"&#8212;and
such is the cry of Browning's victim of Zeus.
He is aware that in his recognition of righteousness he
is himself superior to the evil god who afflicts him;
and as this righteousness is a moral quality, and no
creation of his own consciousness but rather imposed
upon it as an eternal law, he rises past Zeus to the
Potency above him, after which even the undeveloped
sense of a Caliban blindly felt when he discovered a
Quiet above the bitter god Setebos; but the Quiet of
Caliban is a negation of those evil attributes of the
supreme Being, which he reflects upwards from his
own gross heart, not the energy of righteousness which
Ixion demands in his transcendent "Potency." Into
this poem went the energy of Browning's heart and
imagination; some of his matured wisdom entered
into <i>Jochanan Hakkadosh</i>, of which, however, the
contents are insufficient to sustain the length. The
saint and sage of Israel has at the close of his life
found no solution of the riddle of existence. Lover,
bard, soldier, statist, he has obtained in each of his
careers only doubts and dissatisfaction. Twelve
months added to a long life by the generosity of his
admirers, each of whom surrenders a fragment of his
own life to prolong that of the saint, bring him no
clearer illumination&#8212;still all is vanity and vexation
of spirit. Only at the last, when by some unexpected
chance, a final opportunity of surveying the past and
anticipating the future is granted him, all has become
clear. Instead of trying to solve the riddle he accepts
it. He sees from his Pisgah how life, with all its confusions
and contrarieties, is the school which educates
<a name="Page_361"></a>the soul and fits it for further wayfaring. The
ultimate
faith of Jochanan the Saint had been already expressed
by Browning:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Over the ball of it,<br />
</span><span>Peering and prying,<br />
</span><span>How I see all of it,<br />
</span><span>Life there, outlying!<br />
</span><span>Roughness and smoothness,<br />
</span><span>Shine and defilement,<br />
</span><span>Grace and uncouthness:<br />
</span><span>One reconcilement.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>But even to his favourite disciple the sage is unable so
to impart the secret that Tsaddik's mind shall really
embrace it.</p>
<p>The spirit of the saint of Israel is also the spirit of
that wise Dervish of Browning's invention (1884), the
Persian Ferishtah. The volume is frankly didactic,
and Browning, as becomes a master who would make
his lessons easy to children, teaches by parables and
pictures. In reading <i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i> we might
suppose that we were in the Interpreter's House, and
that the Interpreter himself was pointing a moral with
the robin that has a spider in his mouth, or the hen
walking in a fourfold method towards her chickens.
The discourses of the Dervish are in the main theological
or philosophical; the lyrics, which are interposed
between the discourses or discussions, are amatory. In
Persian Poetry much that at first sight might be
taken for amatory has in its inner meaning a mystical
theological sense. Browning reverses the order of
such poetry; he gives us first his doctrine concerning
life or God, and gives it clothed in a parable; then in
a lyric the subject is retracted into the sphere of
human affections, and the truth of theology condenses
<a name="Page_362"></a>itself into a corresponding truth respecting the
love of
man and woman.</p>
<p>Throughout the series of poems it is not a Persian
Dervish who is the speaker and teacher; we hear the
authentic voice of the Dervish born in Camberwell in
the year 1812&#8212;Ferishtah-Browning. The doctrine
set forth is the doctrine of Browning; the manner of
speech is the manner of the poet. The illustrations
and imagery are often Oriental; the ideas are those
of a Western thinker; yet no sense of discordance is
produced. The parable of the starving ravens fed by
an eagle serves happily as an induction; let us become
not waiters on providence, but workers with providence;
and to feed hungry souls is even more needful than
to feed hungry bodies:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>I starve in soul:<br />
</span><span>So may mankind: and since men congregate<br />
</span><span>In towns, not woods&#8212;to Ispahan forthwith!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Such is the lesson of energetic charity. And the
lesson for the acceptance of providential gifts is that
put in words by the poor melon-seller, once the Shah's
Prime Minister&#8212;words spoken in the spirit of the
afflicted Job&#8212;"Shall we receive good at the hand of
God and shall we not receive evil?"<a name="FNanchor_143"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> Or rather&#8212;Shall
not our hearts even in the midst of evil be lifted up
in gratitude at the remembrance of the good which
we have received? Browning proceeds, under a transparent
veil of Oriental fable, to consider the story of
the life of Christ. Do we believe in that tale of wonder
<a name="Page_363"></a>in the full sense of the word belief? The more
it
really concerns us, the more exacting grow our demands
for evidence of its truth; an otiose assent is
easy, but this has none of the potency of genuine conviction.
And, after all, intellectual assent is of little
importance compared with that love for the Divine
which may co-exist as truly with denial as with assent.
<i>The Family</i> sets forth, through a parable, the wisdom
of accepting and living in our human views of things
transcendent. Why pray to God at all? Why not
rather accept His will and His Providential disposition
of our lives as absolutely wise, and right? That,
Browning replies, may be the way of the angels. We
are men, and it is God's will that we should feel and
think as men:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Be man and nothing more&#8212;<br />
</span><span>Man who, as man conceiving, hopes and fears,<br />
</span><span>And craves and deprecates, and loves and loathes,<br />
</span><span>And bids God help him, till death touch his eyes<br />
</span><span>And show God granted most, denying all.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The same spirit of acceptance of our intellectual and
moral limitations is applied in <i>The Sun</i> to the defence
of anthropomorphic religion. Our spirit, burdened
with the good gifts of life, looks upward for relief
in gratitude and praise; but we can praise and thank
only One who is righteous and loving, as we conceive
righteousness and love. Let us not strive to pass
beyond these human feelings and conceptions. Perhaps
they are wholly remote from the unknown reality.
They are none the less the conceptions proper to
humanity; we have no capacities with which to correct
them; let us hold fast by our human best, and preserve,
as the preacher very correctly expressed it, "the
<a name="Page_364"></a>integrity of our anthropomorphism." The
"magnified
non-natural man," and "the three Lord Shaftesburys"
of Matthew Arnold's irony are regarded with no fine
scorn by the intellect of Browning. His early Christian
faith has expanded and taken the non-historical form
of a Humanitarian Theism, courageously accepted, not
as a complete account of the Unknowable, but as the
best provisional conception which we are competent
to form. This theism involves rather than displaces
the truth shadowed forth in the life of Christ. The
crudest theism would seem to him far more reasonable
than to direct the religious emotions towards a "stream
of tendency."</p>
<p>The presence of evil in a world created and governed
by One all-wise, all-powerful, all-loving, is justified in
<i>Mirhab Shah</i> as a necessity of our education. How
shall love be called forth unless there be the possibility
of self-sacrifice? How shall our human sympathy be
perfected unless there be pain? What room is there
for thanks to God or love of man if earth be the scene
of such a blank monotony of well-being as may be
found in the star Rephan? But let us not call evil
good, or think pain in itself a gain. God may see
that evil is null, and that pain is gain; for us the
human view, the human feeling must suffice. This
justification of pain as a needful part of an education
is, however, inapplicable to never-ending retributive
punishment. Such a theological horror Browning rejects
with a hearty indignation, qualified only by a
humorous contempt, in his apologue of <i>A Camel-driver</i>;
her driver, if the camel bites, will with good
cause thwack, and so instruct the brute that mouths
should munch not bite; he will not, six months after<a name="Page_365"></a>wards,
thrust red-hot prongs into the soft of her flesh
to hiss there. And God has the advantage over the
driver of seeing into the camel's brain and of knowing
precisely what moved the creature to offend. The
poem which follows is directed against asceticism. Self-sacrifice
for the sake of our fellows is indeed "joy
beyond joy." As to the rest&#8212;the question is not
whether we fast or feast, but whether, fasting or
feasting, we do our day's work for the Master. If we
would supply joy to our fellows, it is needful that we
should first know joy ourselves&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Therefore, desire joy and thank God for it!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Browning's argument is not profound, and could
adroitly be turned against himself; but his temperament
would survive his argument; his capacity for
manifold pleasures was great, and he not only valued
these as good in themselves, but turned them to
admirable uses. A feast of the senses was to him as
spiritually precious as a fast might be to one who only
by fasting could attain to higher joys than those of
sense. And this, he would maintain, is a better condition
for a human being than that which renders
expedient the plucking out of an eye, the cutting off
of a hand. Joy for Browning means praise and gratitude;
and in recognising the occasions for such praise
and thanks let us not wind ourselves too high. Let
us praise God for the little things that are so considerately
fitted to our little human wants and desires.
The morning-stars will sing together without our help;
if we must choose our moment for a <i>Te Deum</i>, let it
be when we have enjoyed our plate of cherries. The
glorious lamp in the Shah's pavilion lightens other
<a name="Page_366"></a>eyes than mine; but to think that the Shah's
goodness
has provided slippers for my feet in my own small
chamber, and of the very colour that I most affect!
Nor, in returning thanks, should it cause us trouble
that our best thanks are poor, or even that they are
mingled with an alloy of earthly regards, "mere
man's motives&#8212;"</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Alas, Friend, what was free from this alloy,&#8212;<br />
</span><span>Some smatch thereof,&#8212;in best and purest love<br />
</span><span>Preferred thy earthly father? Dust thou art,<br />
</span><span>Dust shall be to the end.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Our little human pleasures&#8212;do they seem unworthy
to meet the eye of God? That is a question put by
distrust and spiritual pride. God gives each of us His
little plot, within which each of us is master. The
question is not what compost, what manure, makes
fruitful the soil; we need not report to the Lord of the
soil the history of our manures; let us treat the ground
as seems best, if only we bring sacks to His granary
in autumn. Nay, do not I also tickle the palate of
my ass with a thistle-bunch, so heartening him to do
his work?</p>
<p>In <i>A Pillar at Sebzevah</i>, Ferishtah-Browning confronts
the objection that he has deposed knowledge
and degraded humanity to the rank of an ass whose
highest attainment is to love&#8212;what? "Husked
lupines, and belike the feeder's self." The Dervish
declares without shrinking the faith that is in him:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"Friend," quoth Ferishtah, "all I seem to know<br />
</span><span>Is&#8212;I know nothing save that love I can<br />
</span><span>Boundlessly, endlessly."<br />

<p>If there be knowledge it shall vanish away; but charity
never faileth. As for knowledge, the prize is in the
<a name="Page_367"></a>process; as gain we must mistrust it, not as a
road
to gain:&#8212;</p>

<p>Grasping at the sun, a child captures an orange:
what if he were to scorn his capture and refuse to suck
its juice? The curse of life is this&#8212;that every supposed
accession to knowledge, every novel theory, is
accepted as a complete solution of the whole problem,
while every pleasure is despised as transitory or insubstantial.
In truth the drop of water found in the
desert sand is infinitely precious; the mirage is only a
mirage. Browning, who in this volume puts forth his
own doctrine of theism, his justification of prayer, his
belief in a superintending providence, his explanation
of the presence of evil in the world, is, of course, no
Pyrrhonist. He profoundly distrusts the capacity of
the intellect, acting as a pure organ of speculation, to
unriddle the mysteries of existence; he maintains, on
the other hand, that knowledge sufficient for the conduct
of our lives is involved in the simple experiences of
good and evil, of joy and sorrow. In reality Browning's
attitude towards truth approaches more nearly what
has now begun to style itself "Pragmatism" than it
approaches Pyrrhonism; but philosophers whose joy
is to beat the air may find that it is condemnatory of
their methods.</p>
<p>In his distrust of metaphysical speculation and in
regarding the affections as superior to the intellect,
Browning as a teacher has something in common with
Comte; but there is perhaps no creed so alien to his
<a name="Page_368"></a>nature as the creed of Positivism. The last of
Ferishtah's
discourses is concerned with the proportion which
happiness bears to pain in the average life of man, or
rather&#8212;for Browning is nothing if he is not individualistic&#8212;in
the life of each man as an individual. The
conclusion arrived at is that no "bean-stripe"&#8212;each
bean, white or black, standing for a day&#8212;is wholly
black, and that the more extended is our field of vision
the more is the general aspect of the "bean-stripe" of
a colour intermediate between the extremes of darkness
and of light. Before the poem closes, Browning
turns aside to consider the Positivist position. Why
give our thanks and praise for all the good things of
life to God, whose existence is an inference of the
heart derived from its own need of rendering gratitude
to some Being like ourselves? Are not these good
things the gifts of the race, of Humanity, and its
worthies who have preceded us and who at the present
moment constitute our environment of loving help?
Ferishtah's reply, which is far from conclusive, must
be regarded as no discussion of the subject but the
utterance of an isolated thought. Praise rendered to
Humanity and the heroes of the race simply reverts to
the giver of the praise; his own perceptions of what
is praiseworthy alone render praise possible; he must
first of all thank and praise the giver of such perceptions&#8212;God.
It is strange that Browning should fail
to recognise the fact that the Positivist would immediately
trace the power of moral perception to the
energies of Humanity in its upward progress from
primitive savagery to our present state of imperfect
development.</p>
<p>It has been necessary to transcribe in a reduced
<a name="Page_369"></a>form the teaching of Ferishtah, for this is the
clearest
record left by Browning of his own beliefs on the
most important of all subjects, this is an essential part
of his criticism of life, and at the same time it is little
less than a passage of autobiography. The poems are
admirable in their vigour, their humour, their seriousness,
their felicity of imagery. Yet the wisdom of
<i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i> is an old man's wisdom; we perceive
in it the inner life, as Baxter puts it, in speaking of
changes wrought by his elder years, quitting the leaves
and branches and drawing down to the root. But
when in prologue or epilogue to this volume or that
Browning touches upon the great happiness, the great
sorrow of his own life, he is always young. Here the
lyrical epilogue is inspired by a noble enthusiasm, and
closes with a surprise of beauty. What if all his happy
faith in the purpose of life, and the Divine presence
through all its course, were but a reflex from the
private and personal love that had once been his and
was still above and around him? Such a doubt contained
its own refutation:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Only, at heart's utmost joy and triumph,
terror<br />
</span><span>Sudden turns the blood to ice: a chill wind disencharms<br />
</span><span>All the late enchantment! What if all be error&#8212;<br />
</span><span>If the halo irised round my head were, Love, thine arms?<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>All the more, if this were so, must the speaker's heart
turn Godwards in gratitude. The whole design of the
volume with its theological parables and its beautiful
lyrics of human love implies that there is a correspondency
between the truths of religion and the truths of
the passion of love between man and woman.</p>

<p> Of the mother in this poem, a writer in the "Browning

Papers," Miss E.D. West, said justly: "There is discernible in her no
soul which could be cleansed from guilt by any purgatorial process....
Her fault had not been moral, had not been sin, to be punished by pain
inflicted on the soul; it was merely the uncounteracted primary
instinct of
self-preservation, and as such it is fitliest dealt with by the simple
depriving
her, without further penalty, of the very life which she had secured

<h2>Closing Works and Days</h2>
<br />
<p><i>Parleyings with Certain People of Importance in their
Day</i>, published in 1887, Browning's last volume but
one, betrays not the slightest decline in his mental
vigour. It suffers, however, from the fact that several
of the "Parleyings" are discussions&#8212;emotional, it is
true, as well as intellectual&#8212;of somewhat abstract
themes, that these discussions are often prolonged beyond
what the subject requires, and that the "People
of Importance" are in some instances not men and
women, but mere sounding-boards to throw out
Browning's own voice. When certain aspects or
principles of art are considered in <i>Fra Lippo Lippi</i>,
before us stands Brother Lippo himself, a living,
breathing figure, on whom our interest must needs
fasten whatever may be the subject of his discourse.
There is of course a propriety in connecting a debate
on evil in the world as a means to good with the
name of the author of "The Fable of the Bees," there
is no impropriety in connecting a study of the philosophy
of music with the name of Charles Avison the
Newcastle organist; but we do not make acquaintance
through the parleyings with either Avison or
Mandeville. This objection does not apply to all the
poems. The parleying <i>With Daniel Bartoli</i> is a story
of love and loss, admirable in its presentation of the
<a name="Page_371"></a>heroine and the unheroic hero. We are interested
in
Francis Furini, "good priest, good man, good painter,"
before he begins to preach his somewhat portentous
sermon on evolution. And in the case of Christopher
Smart, the question why once and only once he was a
divinely inspired singer is the question which most
directly leads to a disclosure of his character as a poet.
The volume, however, as a whole, while Browning's
energy never flags, has a larger proportion than its
predecessors of what he himself terms "mere grey
argument"; and, as if to compensate this, it is remarkable
for sudden outbursts of imagination and
passion, as if these repressed for a time had carried
away the dykes and dams, and went on their career
in full flood. The description of the glory of sunrise
in <i>Bernard de Mandeville</i>, the description of the
Chapel in <i>Christopher Smart</i>, the praise of a woman's
beauty in <i>Francis Furini</i>, the amazing succession of
mythological <i>tours de force</i> in <i>Gerard de Lairesse</i>, the
delightful picture of the blackcap tugging at his prize,
a scrap of rag on the garden wall, amid the falling
snow of March, in the opening of <i>Charles Avison</i>&#8212;these
are sufficient evidence of the abounding force of
Browning's genius as a poet at a date when he had
passed the three score years and ten by half an added
decade. Nor would we willingly forget that magical
lyric of life and death, of the tulip beds and the daisied
grave-mound&#8212;"Dance, yellows and whites and reds"&#8212;which
closes <i>Gerard de Lairesse</i>. Wordsworth's
daffodils are hardly a more jocund company than
Browning's wind-tossed tulips; he accepts their gladness,
and yet the starved grass and daisies are more
to him than these:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><a name="Page_372"></a><span>Daisies and grass be
my heart's bed-fellows<br />
</span><span>On the mound wind spares and sunshine mellows:<br />
</span><span>Dance you, reds and whites and yellows!<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Of failure in intellectual or imaginative force the
<i>Parleyings</i> show no symptom. But the vigour of
Browning's will did a certain wrong to his other
powers. He did not wait, as in early days, for the
genuine casual inspirations of pleasure. He made it
his task to work out all that was in him. And what
comes to a writer of genius is better than what is
laboriously sought. We may gather wood for the
altar, but the true fire must descend from heaven.
The speed and excitement kindled by one's own
exertions are very different from the varying stress
of a wind that bears one onward without the thump
and rattle of the engine-room. It would have been
a gain if Browning's indomitable steam-engines had
occasionally ceased to ply, and he had been compelled
to wait for a propitious breeze.</p>
<p>Philosophy, Love, Poetry, Politics, Painting (the
nude, with a discourse concerning evolution), Painting
again (the modern <i>versus</i> the mythological in art),
Music, and, if we add the epilogue, the Invention of
Printing&#8212;these are the successive themes of Browning's
<i>Parleyings</i>, and they are important and interesting
themes. Unfortunately the method of discussion is
neither sufficiently abstract for the lucid exposition
of ideas, nor sufficiently concrete for the pure communication
of poetic pleasure. Abstract and concrete
meet and take hands or jostle, too much as skeleton
and lady might in a <i>danse Macabre</i>. The spirit of
acquiescence&#8212;strenuous not indolent acquiescence&#8212;with
our intellectual limitations is constantly present.
<a name="Page_373"></a>Does man groan because he cannot comprehend the
mind outside himself which manifests itself in the
sun? Well, did not Prometheus draw the celestial
rays into the pin-point of a flame which man can
order, and which does him service? Is the fire a
little thing beside the immensity in the heavens
above us?</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Little? In little, light, warmth, life are
blessed&#8212;<br />
</span><span>Which, in the large, who sees to bless?<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Or again&#8212;it is Christopher Smart, who triumphs for
once so magnificently in his "Song to David," and
fails, with all his contemporaries, in the poetry of
ambitious instruction. And why? Because for once
he was content with the first step that poetry should
take&#8212;to confer enjoyment, leaving instruction&#8212;the
fruit of enjoyment&#8212;to come later. True learning
teaches through love and delight, not through pretentious
didactics,&#8212;a truth forgotten by the whole tribe
of eighteenth century versifiers. And once more&#8212;does
Francis Furini paint the naked body in all its
beauty? Right! let him study precisely this divine
thing the body, before he looks upward; let him retire
from the infinite into his proper circumscription:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Only by looking low, ere looking high,<br />
</span><span>Comes penetration of the mystery.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>So also with our view of the mingled good and evil
in the world; perhaps to some transcendent vision evil
may wholly disappear; perhaps we shall ourselves make
this discovery as we look back upon the life on earth.
Meanwhile it is as men that we must see things, and
even if evil be an illusion (as Browning trusts), it is a
<a name="Page_374"></a>needful illusion in our educational process,
since through
evil we become aware of good. Thus at every point
Browning accepts here, as in <i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i>, a
limited provisional knowledge as sufficient for our
present needs, with a sustaining hope which extends
into the future. On the other hand, if your affair is
not the sincerity of thought and feeling, but a design
to rule the mass of men for your own advantage, you
must act in a different spirit. Do not, in the manner
of Bubb Doddington, attempt to impose upon your
fellows with the obvious and worn-out pretence that
all you do has been undertaken on their behalf and
in their interests. There is a newer and a better
trick than that. Assume the supernatural; have a
"mission "; have a "message"; be earnest, with all
the authority of a divine purpose. Play boldly this
new card of statesmanship, and you may have from
time to time as many inconsistent missions and
messages as ambitious statecraft can suggest to you.
Through all your gyrations the admiring crowd will
still stand agape. Was Browning's irony of a cynical
philosophy of statesmanship suggested by his view of
the procedure of a politician, whom he had once
admired, whose talents he still recognised, but from
whom he now turned away with indignant aversion?
However this may have been, his poems which touch
on politics do not imply that respect for the people
thinking, feeling, and moving, in masses which is a
common profession with the liberal leaders of the
platform. Browning's liberalism was a form of his
individualism; he, like Shakespeare, had a sympathy
with the wants and affections of the humblest human
lives; and, like Shakespeare, he thought that foolish
<a name="Page_375"></a>or incompetent heads are often conjoined with
hearts
that in a high degree deserve respect.</p>
<p><i>Asolando</i>, the last volume of a long array, was
published in London on the last day of Browning's
life. As he lay dying in Venice, telegraphed tidings
reached his son of the eager demand for copies made
in anticipation of its appearance and of the instant
and appreciative reviews; Browning heard the report
with a quiet gratification. It is happy when praise in
departing is justified, and this was the case with a
collection of poems which to some readers seemed like
a revival of the poetry of its author's best years of
early and mid manhood. <i>Asolando</i> is, however, in the
main distinctly an autumn gathering, a handful of
flowers and fruit belonging to the Indian summer of
his genius. The Prologue is a confession, like that of
Wordsworth's great Ode, that a glory has passed away
from the earth. When first he set eyes on Asolo,
some fifty years previously, the splendour of Italian
landscape seemed that of</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Terror with beauty, like the Bush<br />
</span><span>Burning yet unconsumed<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>Now, while the beauty remains, the flame is extinct&#8212;"the
Bush is bare." Browning finds his consolation in
the belief that he has come nearer to the realities of
earth by discarding fancies, and that his wonder and awe
are more wisely directed towards the transcendent God
than towards His creatures. But in truth what the
mind confers is a fact and no fancy; the loss of what
Browning calls the "soul's iris-bow" is the loss of a
substantial, a divine possession. The <i>Epilogue</i> has in
it a certain energy, but the thews are those of an old
<a name="Page_376"></a>athlete, and through the energy we are conscious
of
the strain. The speaker pitches his voice high, as if
it could not otherwise be heard at a distance. The
<i>Reverie</i>, a speculation on the time when Power will
show itself fully and therefore be known as love, has
some of that vigorous intellectual garrulity which had
grown on Browning during the years when unhappily
for his poetry he came to be regarded chiefly as a
prophet and a sage. An old man rightly values the
truths which experience has made real for him; he
repeats them again and again, for they constitute the
best gift he can offer to his disciples; but his utterances
are not always directly inspired; they are sometimes
faintly echoed from an earlier inspiration. In the
<i>Reverie</i>, while accepting our limitations of knowledge,
which he can term ignorance in its contrast with the
vast unknown, Browning discovers in the moral consciousness
of man a prophecy of the ultimate triumph
of good over what we think of as evil, a prophecy of
the final reconciliation of love with power. And
among the laws of life is not merely submission but
aspiration:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Life is&#8212;to wake not sleep,<br />
</span><span>Rise and not rest, but press<br />
</span><span>From earth's level where blindly creep<br />
</span><span>Things perfected, more or less,<br />
</span><span>To the heaven's height, far and steep,<br />
</span><span>Where amid what strifes and storms<br />
</span><span>May wait the adventurous quest,<br />
</span><span>Power is love.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>The voice of the poet of <i>Paracelsus</i> and of <i>Rabbi Ben
Ezra</i> is still audible in this latest of his prophesyings.
And therefore he welcomes earth in his <i>Rephan</i>, earth,
<a name="Page_377"></a>with its whole array of failures and despairs,
as the fit
training-ground for man. Better its trials and losses
and crosses than a sterile uniformity of happiness;
better its strife than rest in any golden mean of excellence.
Nor are its intellectual errors and illusions
without their educational value. It is better, as
<i>Development</i>, with its recollections of Browning's childhood,
assures us that the boy should believe in Troy
siege, and the combats of Hector and Achilles, as
veritable facts of history, than bend his brow over
Wolfs Prolegomena or perplex his brain with moral
philosophies to grapple with which his mind is not
yet competent. By and by his illusions will disappear
while their gains will remain.</p>
<p>The general impression left by <i>Asolando</i> is that of
intellectual and imaginative vigour. The series of
<i>Bad Dreams</i> is very striking and original in both
pictorial and passionate power. <i>Dubiety</i> is a poem of
the Indian Summer, but it has the beauty, with a
touch of the pathos, proper to the time. The love
songs are rather songs of praise than of passion, but
they are beautiful songs of praise, and that entitled
<i>Speculative</i>, which is frankly a poem of old age, has
in it the genuine passion of memory. <i>White Witchcraft</i>
does in truth revive the manner of earlier
volumes. The</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Infinite passion and the pain<br />
</span><span>Of finite hearts that yearn<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>told of in a poem of 1855 is present, with a touch of
humour to guard it from its own excess in the admirable
<i>Inapprehensiveness</i>. The speaker who may not
liberate his soul can perhaps identify a quotation, and
<a name="Page_378"></a>he gallantly accepts his humble r&ocirc;le in
the tragi-comedy
of foiled passion:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"No, the book<br />
</span><span>Which noticed how the wall-growths wave," said she,<br />
</span><span>"Was not by Ruskin."<br />
</span><span>I said "Vernon Lee."<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>And in the uttered "Vernon Lee" lies a vast renunciation
half comical and wholly tragic. There are jests
in the volume, and these, with the exception of <i>Ponte
dell' Angelo</i>, have the merit of brevity; they buzz
swiftly in and out, and do not wind about us with the
terror of voluminous coils, as sometimes happens when
Browning is in his mood of mirth. There are stories,
and they are told with spirit and with skill. In
<i>Beatrice Signorini</i> the story-teller does justice to the
honest jealousy of a wife and to the honest love of a
husband who returns from the wanderings of his
imagination to the frank fidelity of his heart.
Cynicism grows genial in the jest of <i>The Pope and
the Net</i>. In <i>Muckle-Mouth Meg</i>, laughter and kisses,
audible from the page, and a woman's art in love-craft,
turn tragedy in a hearty piece of comedy. <i>The Bean-Feast</i>
presents us with the latest transformation of the
Herakles ideal, where a good Christian Herakles, Pope
Sixtus of Rome, makes common cause with his spiritual
children in their humble pleasures of the senses. And in
contrast with this poem of the religion of joy is the story
of another ruler of Rome, the too fortunate Emperor
Augustus, who, in the shadow of the religion of fear
and sorrow, must propitiate the envy of Fate by turning
beggar once a year. A shivering thrill runs
through us as we catch a sight of the supreme
<a name="Page_379"></a>mendicant's "sparkling eyes beneath their
eyebrows'
ridge":</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"He's God!" shouts Lucius Varus Rufus: "Man<br />
</span><span>And worms'-meat any moment!" mutters low<br />
</span><span>Some Power, admonishing the mortal-born.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>There were nobler sides of Paganism than this with
which Browning seems never to have had an adequate
sympathy. And yet the religion even of Marcus
Aurelius lacked something of the joy of the religion
of the thankful Pope who feasted upon beans.<a name="FNanchor_144"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>
<p>In the winter which followed his change of abode from
Warwick Crescent to the more commodious house in
De Vere Gardens, the winter of 1887-1888, Browning's
health and strength visibly declined; a succession of
exhausting colds lowered his vitality; yet he maintained
his habitual ways of life, and would not yield.
In August 1888 he started ill for his Italian holiday, and
travelled with difficulty and distress. But the rest
among the mountains at Primiero restored him. At
Venice he seemed as vigorous as he was joyous. And
when he returned to London in February 1889 the
improvement in his strength was in a considerable
measure maintained. Yet it was evident that the
<a name="Page_380"></a>physical vigour which had seemed invincible was
on
the ebb. In the early summer he paid the last of
those visits, which he so highly valued, to Balliol
College, Oxford. The opening week of June found
him at Cambridge. Mr Gosse has told how on the
first Sunday of that month Browning and he sat
together "in a sequestered part of the beautiful Fellows'
Garden of Trinity," under a cloudless sky, amid the
early foliage with double hawthorns in bloom, and
how the old man, in a mood of serenity and without
his usual gesticulation, talked of his own early life and
aspirations. He shrank that summer, says Mrs Orr,
from the fatigue of a journey to Italy and thought of
Scotland as a place of rest. But unfavourable weather
in early August forbade the execution of the plan.
An invitation from Mrs Bronson to her house at Asolo,
to be followed by the pleasure of seeing his son and
his son's wife in the Palazzo Rezzonico, Venice, were
attractions not to be resisted, and in company with
Miss Browning, he reached the little hill-town that
had grown so dear to him without mishap and even
without fatigue.</p>
<p>To the early days of July, shortly before his departure
for Italy, belong two incidents which may be placed
side by side as exhibiting two contrasted sides of
Browning's character. On the 5th of that month he
dined with the Shah, who begged for the gift of one
of his books. Next day he chose a volume the binding
of which might, as he says, "take the imperial eye";
but the pleasure of the day was another gift, a gift to
a person who was not imperial. "I said to myself,"
he wrote to his young friend the painter Lehmann's
daughter, addressed in the letter as "My beloved
<a name="Page_381"></a>Alma"&#8212;"I said to myself 'Here do I present my
poetry to a personage for whom I do not care three
straws; why should I not venture to do as much for
a young lady I love dearly, who, for the author's sake,
will not impossibly care rather for the inside than the
outside of the volume?' So I was bold enough to
take one and offer it for your kind acceptance, begging
you to remember in days to come that the author,
whether a good poet or not, was always, my Alma,
your affectionate friend, Robert Browning." A gracious
bowing of old age over the grace and charm of youth!
But the work of two days later, July 8th, was not
gracious. The lines "To Edward Fitzgerald," printed
in <i>The Athenaeum</i>, were dated on that day. It is stated
by Mrs Orr that when they were despatched to the
journal in which they appeared, Browning regretted
the deed, though afterwards he found reasons to justify
himself. Fitzgerald's reference to Mrs Browning caused
him a spasm of pain and indignation, nor did the pain
for long subside. The expression of his indignation
was outrageous in manner, and deficient in real power.
He had read a worse meaning into the unhappy words
than had been intended, and the writer was dead.
Browning's act was like an involuntary muscular contraction,
which he could not control. The lines sprang
far more from love than from hate. "I felt as if she
had died yesterday," he said. We cannot regret that
Browning was capable of such an offence; we can
only regret that what should have controlled his
cry of pain and rage did not operate at the right
moment.</p>
<p>In Asolo, beside "the gate," Mrs Bronson had found
and partly made what Mr Henry James describes as
"<a name="Page_382"></a>one of the quaintest possible little places of <i>villegiatura</i>"&#8212;La
Mura, the house, "resting half upon
the dismantled, dissimulated town-wall. No sweeter
spot in all the sweetnesses of Italy." Browning's last
visit to Asolo was a time of almost unmingled enjoyment.
"He seemed possessed," writes Mrs Orr, "by
a strange buoyancy, an almost feverish joy in life."
The thought that he was in Asolo again, which he had
first seen in his twenty-sixth year, and since then had
never ceased to remember with affection, was a happy
wonder to him. He would stand delighted on the
loggia of La Mura, looking out over the plain and
identifying the places of historical interest, some of
which were connected with his own "Sordello." Nor
was the later story forgotten of Queen Caterina Cornaro,
whose palace-tower overlooks Asolo, and whose secretary,
Cardinal Bembo, wrote <i>gli Asolani</i>, from which
came the suggestion for the title of Browning's forthcoming
volume. At times, as Mrs Bronson relates,
the beauty of the prospect was enough, with no
historical reminiscences, the plain with its moving
shadows, the mountain-ranges to the west, and southwards
the delicate outline of the Euganean Hills. "I
was right," said he, "to fall in love with this place fifty
years ago, was I not?"</p>
<p>The procedure of the day at Asolo was almost as
regular as that of a London day. The morning walk
with his sister, when everything that was notable was
noted by his keen eyes, the return, English newspapers,
proof-sheets, correspondence, the light mid-day meal,
the afternoon drive in Mrs Branson's carriage, tea upon
the loggia, the evening with music or reading, or visits
to the little theatre&#8212;these constituted an almost un<a name="Page_383"></a>varying
and happy routine. On his walks he delighted
to recognise little details of architecture which he had
observed in former years; or he would peer into the
hedgerows and watch the living creatures that lurked
there, or would "whistle softly to the lizards basking
on the low walls which border the roads, to try his old
power of attracting them."<a name="FNanchor_145"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> Sometimes a longer drive
(and that to Bassano was his favourite) required an
earlier start in the carriage with luncheon at some
little inn. "If we were ever late in returning to Asolo,"
Mrs Bronson writes, "he would say 'Tell Vittorio to
drive quickly; we must not lose the sunset from the
loggia.' ... Often after a storm, the effects of sun
breaking through clouds before its setting, combined
with the scenery of plain and mountain, were such as
to rouse the poet to the greatest enthusiasm. Heedless
of cold or damp, forgetting himself completely, though
warmly wrapped to please others, he would gaze on
the changing aspects of earth and sky until darkness
covered everything from his sight."</p>
<p>When in the evenings Browning read aloud he did
not, like Tennyson, as described by Mr Rossetti, allow
his voice to "sway onward with a long-drawn chaunt"
which gave "noble value and emphasis to the metrical
structure and pauses." His delivery was full and distinctive,
but it "took much less account than Tennyson's
of the poem as a rhythmical whole; his delivery had
more affinity to that of an actor, laying stress on all
the light and shade of the composition&#8212;its touches of
character, the conversational points, its dramatic give-and-take.
In those qualities of elocution in which
Tennyson was strong, and aimed to be strong, Brown<a name="Page_384"></a>ing
was contentedly weak; and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>."<a
 name="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a>
Sometimes,
like another great poet, Pope, he was deeply
affected by the passion of beauty or heroism or pathos
in what he read, and could not control his feelings.
Mrs Orr mentions that in reading aloud his translation
of the <i>Herakles</i>, he, like Pope in reading a passage of
his <i>Iliad</i>, was moved to tears. Dr Furnivall tells of
the mounting excitement with which he once delivered
in the writer's hearing his <i>Ixion</i>. When at La Mura
after his dreamy playing, on a spinet of 1522, old airs,
melodious, melancholy airs, Browning would propose
to read aloud, it was not his own poetry that he most
willingly chose. "No R.B. to-night," he would say;
"then with a smile, 'Let us have some real poetry'";
and the volume would be one by Shelley or Keats, or
Coleridge or Tennyson. It was as a punishment to
his hostess for the crime of having no Shakespeare on
her shelves that he threatened her with one of his
"toughest poems"; but the tough poem, interpreted
by his emphasis and pauses, became "as clear and
comprehensible as one could possibly desire." In his
talk at Asolo "he seemed purposely to avoid deep and
serious topics. If such were broached in his presence
he dismissed them with one strong, convincing sentence,
and adroitly turned the current of conversation into a
shallower channel."</p>
<p>A project which came very near his heart was that
of purchasing from the municipal authorities a small
piece of ground, divided from La Mura by a ravine
clothed with olive and other trees, "on which stood an
unfinished building"&#8212;the words are Mrs Bronson's&#8212;"commanding
<a name="Page_385"></a>the finest view in Asolo." He desired
much to have a summer or autumn abode to which
he might turn with the assurance of rest in what most
pleased and suited him. In imagination, with his
characteristic eagerness, he had already altered and
added to the existing structure, and decided on the
size and aspect of the loggia which was to out-rival
that of La Mura. "'It shall have a tower,' he said,
'whence I can see Venice at every hour of the day,
and I shall call it "Pippa's Tower".... We will
throw a rustic bridge across the streamlet in the
ravine.'" And then, in a graver mood: "It may
not be for me to enjoy it long&#8212;who can say? But
it will be useful for Pen and his family.... But I
am good for ten years yet." And when his son
visited Asolo and approved of the project of Pippa's
Tower, Browning's happiness in his dream was complete.
It was on the night of his death that the
authorities of Asolo decided that the purchase might
be carried into effect.</p>

<h5>THE PALAZZO REZZONICO, VENICE.</h5>
<h5><i>From a drawing by</i> Miss KATHERINE KIMBALL.</h5>
<p>For a time during this last visit to Asolo Browning
suffered some inconvenience from shortness of breath
in climbing hills, but the discomfort passed away.
He looked forward to an early return to England,
spoke with pleasant anticipation of the soft-pedal
piano which his kind friend Mrs Bronson desired to
procure at Boston and place in his study in De Vere
Gardens, and he dreamed of future poetical achievements.
"Shall I whisper to you my ambition and my
hope?" he asked his hostess. "It is to write a tragedy
better than anything I have done yet. I think of it
constantly." With the end of October the happy days
at Asolo were at an end. On the first of November
<a name="Page_386"></a>he was in Venice, "magnificently lodged," he
says,
"in this vast palazzo, which my son has really shown
himself fit to possess, so surprising are his restorations
and improvements." At Asolo he had parted
from his American friend Story with the words,
"More than forty years of friendship and never a
break." In Venice he met an American friend of
more recent years, Professor Corson, who describes
him as stepping briskly, with a look that went everywhere,
and as cheerfully anticipating many more years
of productive work.<a name="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a>
Yet in truth the end was near.
Dining with Mr and Mrs Curtis, where he read aloud
some poems of his forthcoming volume, he met a
London physician, Dr Bird. Next evening Dr Bird
again dined with Browning, who expressed confident
satisfaction as to his state of health, and held out his
wrist that his words might be confirmed by the regularity
and vigour of his pulse. The physician became
at once aware that Browning's confidence was
far from receiving the warrant in which he believed.
Still he maintained his customary two hours' walk
each day. Towards the close of November, on a day
of fog, he returned from the Lido with symptoms of
a bronchial cold. He dealt with the trouble as he
was accustomed, and did not take to his bed. Though
feeling scarcely fit to travel he planned his departure
for England after the lapse of four or five days. On
December 1st, an Italian physician was summoned,
and immediately perceived the gravity of the case.
Within a few days the bronchial trouble was subdued,
but failure of the heart was apparent. Some hours
<a name="Page_387"></a>before the end he said to one of his nurses, "I
feel
much worse. I know now that I must die." The
ebbing away of life was painless. As the clocks of
Venice were striking ten on the night of Thursday,
December 12, 1889, Browning died.<a name="FNanchor_148"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>
<p>He had never concerned himself much about his
place of burial. A lifeless body seemed to him only
an old vesture that had been cast aside. "He had
said to his sister in the foregoing summer," Mrs Orr
tells us, "that he wished to be buried wherever he
might die; if in England, with his mother; if in
France, with his father; if in Italy, with his wife."
The English cemetery in Florence had, however, been
closed. The choice seemed to lie between Venice,
which was the desire of the city, or, if the difficulties
could be overcome by the intervention of Lord
Dufferin, the old Florentine cemetery. The matter
was decided otherwise; a grave in Westminster Abbey
was proposed by Dean Bradley, and the proposal was
accepted.<a name="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a>
A private service took place in the
<i>Palazzo Rezzonico</i>; the coffin, in compliance with
the civic requirements, was conveyed with public
honours to the chapel on the island of San Michele;
and from thence to the house in De Vere Gardens.
On the last day of the year 1889, in presence of a
<a name="Page_388"></a>great and reverent crowd, with solemn music
arranged
for the words of Mrs Browning's poem, "He giveth
his beloved sleep," the body of Browning was laid in
its resting-place in Poets' Corner.</p>
<p>To attempt at the present time to determine the
place of Browning in the history of English poetry is
perhaps premature. Yet the record of "How it
strikes a contemporary" may itself have a certain
historical interest. When estimates of this kind have
been revised by time even their errors are sometimes
instructive, or, if not instructive, are amusing. It is
probable that Tennyson will remain as the chief
representative in poetry of the Victorian period.
Browning, who was slower in securing an audience,
may be found to possess a more independent individuality.
Yet in truth no great writer is independent
of the influences of his age.</p>
<p>Browning as a poet had his origins in the romantic
school of English poetry; but he came at a time
when the romance of external action and adventure
had exhausted itself, and when it became necessary to
carry romance into the inner world where the adventures
are those of the soul. On the ethical and
religious side he sprang from English Puritanism.
Each of these influences was modified by his own
genius and by the circumstances of its development.
His keen observation of facts and passionate inquisition
of human character drew him in the direction
of what is termed realism. This combination of
realism with romance is even more strikingly seen in
an elder contemporary on whose work Browning
bestowed an ardent admiration, the novelist Balzac.
<a name="Page_389"></a>His Puritanism received important modifications
from
his wide-ranging artistic instincts and sympathies, and
again from the liberality of a wide-ranging intellect.
He has the strenuous moral force of Puritanism, but he
is wholly free from asceticism, except in the higher
significance of that word&#8212;the hardy discipline of an
athlete. Opinions count for less than the form and the
habitual attitudes of a soul. These with Browning were
always essentially Christian. He regarded our life on
earth as a state of probation and of preparation;
sometimes as a battle-field in which our test lies in
the choice of the worse or the better side and the
energy of devotion to the cause; sometimes as a
school of education, in the processes of which the
emotions play a larger part than the intellect. The
degrees in that school are not to be taken on earth.
And on the battle-field the final issue is not to be
determined here, so that what appears as defeat may
contain within it an assured promise of ultimate
victory. The attitudes of the spirit which were
most habitual with him were two&#8212;the attitude of
aspiration and the attitude of submission. These he
brought into harmony with each other by his conception
of human life as a period of training for a
higher life; we must make the most vigorous and
joyous use of our schooling, and yet we must press
towards what lies beyond it.</p>
<p>From the romantic poetry of the early years of the
nineteenth century comes a cry or a sigh of limitless
desire. Under the inspiration of the Revolutionary
movement passion had broken the bounds of the
eighteenth century ideal of balance and moderation.
With the transcendental reaction against a mechanical
<a name="Page_390"></a>view of the relation of God to the universe and
to
humanity the soul had put forth boundless claims and
unmeasured aspirations. In his poetic method each
writer followed the leadings of his own genius, without
reference to common rules and standards; the individualism
of the Revolutionary epoch asserted itself
to the full. These several influences helped to
determine the character of Browning's poetry. But
meeting in him the ethical and religious tendencies of
English Puritanism they acquired new significances
and assumed new forms. The cry of desire could not
turn, as it did with Byron, to cynicism; it must not
waste itself, as sometimes happened with Shelley, in
the air or the ether. It must be controlled by the
will and turned to some spiritual uses. The transcendental
feeling which Wordsworth most often
attained through an impassioned contemplation of
external nature must rest upon a broader basis and
include among its sources or abettors all the higher
passions of humanity. The Revolutionary individualism
must be maintained and extended; in his
methods Browning would acknowledge no master; he
would please himself and compel his readers to accept
his method even if strange or singular. As for the
mediaeval revival, which tried to turn aside, and in part
capture, the transcendental tendencies of his time,
Browning rejected it, in the old temper of English
Puritanism, on the side of religion; but on the side
of art it opened certain avenues upon which he
eagerly entered. The scientific movement of the
nineteenth century influenced him partly as a force
to be met and opposed by his militant transcendentalism.
Yet he gives definite expression in <i>Paracelsus</i>
<a name="Page_391"></a>to an idea of evolution both in nature and in
human
society, an idea of evolution which is, however,
essentially theistic. "All that seems proved in
Darwin's scheme," he wrote to Dr Furnivall in 1881,
"was a conception familiar to me from the beginning."
The positive influences of the scientific age in which
he lived upon Browning's work were chiefly these&#8212;first
it tended to intellectualise his instincts, compelling
him to justify them by a definite theory; and secondly
it co-operated with his tendency towards realism as a
student of the facts of human nature; it urged him
towards research in his psychology of the passions;
it supported him in his curious inquisition of the
phenomena of the world of mind.</p>
<p>Being a complete and a sane human creature,
Browning could not rest content with the vicious
asceticism of the intellect which calls itself scientific
because it refuses to recognise any facts that are not
material and tangible. Science itself, in the true sense of
the word, exists and progresses by ventures of imaginative
faith. And in all matters which involve good and
evil, hopes and fears, in all matters which determine the
conduct of life, no rational person excludes from his
view the postulates of our moral nature or should
exclude the final option of the will. The person whose
beliefs are determined by material facts alone and by
the understanding unallied with our other powers is
the irrational and unscientific person. Being a
complete and sane human creature, Browning was
assured that the visible order of things is part of a
larger order, the existence of which alone makes
human life intelligible to the reason. The understanding
being incapable of arriving unaided at a
<a name="Page_392"></a>decision between rival theories of life, and
neutrality
between these being irrational and illegitimate, he
rightly determined the balance with the weight of
emotion, and rightly acted upon that decision with all
the energy of his will. His chief intellectual error
was not that he undervalued the results of the intellect,
but that he imagined the existence as a part of sane
human nature, of a wholly irrational intellect which in
affairs of religious belief and conduct is indifferent
to the promptings of the emotions and the moral
nature.</p>
<p>Browning's optimism has been erroneously ascribed
to his temperament. He declared that in his personal
experience the pain of life outweighed its pleasure.
He remembered former pain more vividly than he
remembered pleasure. His optimism was part of the
vigorous sanity of his moral nature; like a reasonable
man, he made the happiness which he did not find.
If any person should censure the process of giving
objective validity to a moral postulate, he has only to
imagine some extra-human intelligence making a
study of human nature; to such an intelligence our
moral postulates would be objective facts and have
the value of objective evidence. That whole of which
our life on earth forms a part could not be conceived
by Browning as rational without also being conceived
as good.</p>
<p>All the parts of Browning's nature were vigorous,
and they worked harmoniously together. His
senses were keen and alert; his understanding was
both penetrating and comprehensive; his passions had
sudden explosive force and also steadfastness and
persistency; his will supported his other powers and
<a name="Page_393"></a>perhaps it had too large a share in his later
creative
work. His feeling for external nature was twofold;
he enjoyed colour and form&#8212;but especially colour&#8212;as
a feast for the eye, and returned thanks for his
meal as the Pope of his poem did for the bean-feast.
This was far removed from that passionate spiritual contemplation
of nature of the Wordsworthian mood. But
now and again for Browning external nature was, not
indeed suffused as for Wordsworth, but pierced and
shot through with spiritual fire. His chief interest,
however, was in man. The study of passions in their
directness and of the intellect in its tortuous ways
were at various times almost equally attractive to him.
The emotions which he chiefly cared to interpret were
those connected with religion, with art, and with the
relations of the sexes.</p>
<p>In his presentation of character Browning was far
from exhibiting either the universality or the disinterestedness
of Shakespeare. His sympathy with
action was defective. The affections arising from
hereditary or traditional relations are but slenderly
represented in his poetry; the passions which elect
their own objects are largely represented. Those
graceful gaieties arising from a long-established form
of society, which constitute so large a part of
Shakespeare's comedies, are almost wholly absent
from his work. His humour was robust but seldom
fine or delicate. In an age of intellectual and spiritual
conflict and trouble, his art was often deflected from
the highest ends by his concern on behalf of ideas.
He could not rest satisfied, it has been observed, with
contemplating the children of his imagination, nor find
the fulfilment of his aim in the fact of having given
<a name="Page_394"></a>them existence.<a name="FNanchor_150"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a> It seems often as if his
purpose in
creating them was to make them serve as questioners,
objectors, and answerers in the great debate of conflicting
thoughts which proceeds throughout his poems.
His object in transferring his own consciousness into
the consciousness of some imagined personage seems
often to be that of gaining a new stand-point from
which to see another and a different aspect of the
questions concerning which he could not wholly satisfy
himself from any single point of view. He cannot be
content to leave his men and women, in Shakespeare's
disinterested manner, to look in various directions
according to whatever chanced to suit best the temper
and disposition he had imagined for them. They are
placed by him with their eyes turned in very much
the same direction, gazing towards the same problems,
the same ideas. And somehow Browning himself
seems to be in company with them all the time, learning
their different reports of the various aspects which
those problems or ideas present to each of them, and
choosing between the different reports in order to give
credence to that which seems true. The study of no
individual character would seem to him of capital
value unless that character contained something which
should help to throw light upon matters common to
all humanity, upon the inquiries either as to what it is,
or as to what are its relations to the things outside
humanity. This is not quite the highest form of
dramatic poetry. There is in it perhaps something
<a name="Page_395"></a>of the error of seeking too quick returns of
profit, and
of drawing "a circle premature," to use Browning's
own words, "heedless of far gain." The contents of
characters so conceived can be exhausted, whereas when
characters are presented with entire disinterestedness
they may seem to yield us less at first, but they
are inexhaustible. The fault&#8212;if it be one&#8212;lay partly
in Browning's epoch, partly in the nature of his genius.
Such a method of deflected dramatic characterisation
as his is less appropriate to regular drama than to the
monologue; and accordingly the monologue, reflective
or lyrical, became the most characteristic instrument
of his art.</p>
<p>There is little of repose in Browning's poetry. He
feared lethargy of heart, the supine mood, more than
he feared excess of passion. Once or twice he utters
a sigh for rest, but it is for rest after strife or labour.
Broad spaces of repose, of emotional tranquillity are
rare, if not entirely wanting, in his poetry. It is not
a high table-land, but a range, or range upon range, of
sierras. In single poems there is often a point or
moment in which passion suddenly reaches its
culmination. He flashes light upon the retina; he
does not spread truth abroad like a mantle but plunges
it downwards through the mists of earth like a searching
sword-blade. And therefore he does not always
distribute the poetic value of what he writes equally;
one vivid moment justifies all that is preparatory to
that great moment. His utterance, which is always
vigorous, becomes intensely luminous at the needful
points and then relapses, to its well-maintained vigour,
a vigour not always accompanied by the highest
poetical qualities. The music of his verse is entirely
<a name="Page_396"></a>original, and so various are its kinds, so
complex often
are its effects that it cannot be briefly characterised.
Its attack upon the ear is often by surprises, which,
corresponding to the sudden turns of thought and
leaps of feeling, justify themselves as right and
delightful. Yet he sometimes embarrasses his verse
with an excess of suspensions and resolutions.
Browning made many metrical experiments, some
of which were unfortunate: but his failures are
rather to be ascribed to temporary lapses into a
misdirected ingenuity than to the absence of metrical
feeling.</p>
<p>His chief influence, other than what is purely
artistic, upon a reader is towards establishing a connection
between the known order of things in which
we live and move and that larger order of which it is
a part. He plays upon the will, summoning it from
lethargy to activity. He spiritualises the passions by
showing that they tend through what is human towards
what is divine. He assigns to the intellect a
sufficient field for exercise, but attaches more value
to its efforts than to its attainments. His faith in an
unseen order of things creates a hope which persists
through the apparent failures of earth. In a true
sense he may be named the successor of Wordsworth,
not indeed as an artist but as a teacher. Substantially
the creed maintained by each was the same creed,
and they were both more emphatic proclaimers of it
than any other contemporary poets. But their ways
of holding and of maintaining that creed were far
apart. Wordsworth enunciated his doctrines as if he
had never met with, and never expected to meet with,
any gainsaying of them. He discoursed as a philosopher
<a name="Page_397"></a>might to a school of disciples gathered together
to be
taught by his wisdom, not to dispute it. He feared
chiefly not a counter creed but the materialising effects
of the industrial movement of his own day. Expecting
no contradiction, Wordsworth did not care to quit
his own standpoint in order that he might see how
things appear from the opposing side. He did not
argue but let his utterance fall into a half soliloquy
spoken in presence of an audience but not always
directly addressed to them. Browning's manner of
speech was very unlike this. He seems to address it
often to unsympathetic hearers of whose presence and
gainsaying attitude he could not lose sight. The
beliefs for which he pleaded were not in his day, as
they had been in Wordsworth's, part of a progressive
wave of thought. He occupied the disadvantageous
position of a conservative thinker. The later poet of
spiritual beliefs had to make his way not with, but
against, a great incoming tide of contemporary speculation.
Probably on this account Browning's influence
as a teacher will extend over a far shorter space of
time than that of Wordsworth. For Wordsworth is
self-contained, and is complete without reference to
the ideas which oppose his own. His work suffices
for its own explanation, and will always commend
itself to certain readers either as the system of a
philosophic thinker or as the dream of a poet. Browning's
thought where it is most significant is often more
or less enigmatical if taken by itself: its energetic
gestures, unless we see what they are directed
against, seem aimless beating the air. His thought,
as far as it is polemical, will probably cease to
interest future readers. New methods of attack will
<a name="Page_398"></a>call forth new methods of defence. Time will
make its discreet selection from his writings. And
the portion which seems most likely to survive is
that which presents in true forms of art the permanent
passions of humanity and characters of enduring
interest.</p>

***** This file should be named 12817-h.htm or 12817-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Jonathan Ingram, Wilelmina Mallière and the Online
Distributed Proofreading Team.


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
